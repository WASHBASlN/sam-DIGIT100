            <p class="size">
                my name is sam! I'm a freshman studying [???] at penn state behrend. i swim there as well, which is something i've been doing for most of my life. my favorite events are the sprint freestyle events (especially the 50y free)

             <p class="size">
                 despite the absurd amount of time i spend in the pool at at the gym for swim, i do have hobbies. i draw (i'm not that good, but i'm having fun), write, play video games, and collect swords and other various trinkets. i have 3 swords, some knives and daggers, and two animal skulls (deer and bear). i just <i>love</i> to collect and amass trinkets and items.

                 this page was made for my DIGIT100 class. i'm a novice at web development and I've been bumbling through this with very minimal knowledge. i like to think I'm doing alright, but there's always room for improvement. so far, though, i've been having a blast with this. i want to make more things like this for my own personal use later on.
