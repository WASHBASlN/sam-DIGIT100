                    my name is sam! I'm a freshman studying [???] at penn state behrend. i swim there as well, which is something i've been doing for most of my life. my favorite events are the sprint freestyle events (especially the 50y free)

                <p class="size">
                    despite the absurd amount of time i spend in the pool at at the gym for swim, i do have hobbies. i draw (i'm not that good, but i'm having fun), write, play video games, and collect swords and other various trinkets. i have 3 swords, some knives and daggers, and two animal skulls (deer and bear). i just <i>love</i> to collect and amass trinkets and items.
