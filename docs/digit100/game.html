                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p class="size">
                    For this assignment, I installed and played through <a href="https://dino999z.itch.io/therapy-with-dr-albert-krueger" class="size">Therapy With Dr. Albert Krueger (TWDAK)</a>, developed by dino999z on itch.io. Now, first impressions. I like the look of this game. The colors, the pixel graphics, the character designs… I love just about everything about this game. 
                </p>
                <p class="size">DISCLAIMER!! All artwork and characters mentioned belong to <a href="https://dino999z.itch.io/" class="size">dino999z</a> on itch.io!</p>
                <p class="size">
                    In the game, you play as a teen named Taylor Lee. Taylor awakens in a therapist’s office, utterly confused as they had not scheduled an appointment for therapy. They’re called up to an office to meet their therapist, Dr. Albert Krueger. During their session, Dr. Krueger administers a couple of tests to Taylor that you, the player, are responsible for completing. 
                </p>
                <p class="size">
                    The tests begin with a basic math test, in which you perform basic computations and click on the correct answer. Then, there’s a short break in which you get to learn a bit about Dr. Krueger’s background. Next up is a cup-and-ball game, in which the cups are shuffled around and you pick which one the ball is under. The movement of the cups gets harder to track with each round. After this is another short break. Someone calls Dr. Krueger with a problem, and he tells them to calm down and think rationally, as the inferred solution they gave is utterly absurd. The next test is less of a test and more of a trust-establishing exercise between doctor and patient. Dr. Krueger asks a question, and Taylor answers it. They are asked to keep their eyes shut, though. After each question, you’re given the option to open your eyes or keep them shut. Then, another break, in which a man can be heard making a commotion in the hallway. Dr. Krueger gets up to deal with it, and puts on a short video for you to watch in the meantime. Finally, the Rorschach test. You’re shown an ink blot. You can choose what you think it looks like. None of these answers have an effect on the result, however, whether or not you flip over the ink blot paper does. You’re given a patient satisfaction quiz (your answers here don’t matter, either– they’re always swapped to the smiley face anyway). Then, you’re given the results.

                <h2>CHARACTERS & WORLD</h2>
                <p class="size">
                    The world within this game isn’t too broad, it mostly takes place within Dr. Krueger’s office. The two main characters within the game are Taylor and Dr. Krueger, though other characters are mentioned. For example, there are at least 3 other patients– the one whose eyeball Krueger… “borrows” for the cup-and-ball test, the one that calls Dr. Krueger on the phone, and the third one, who can be heard screaming in the hallway.

                <p class="size">
                    More fascinating, though, is a character named Vincent. He’s only mentioned, and we get to see in illustration (drawn by Krueger) in the 3rd of the game (more on different endings later). Vincent was one of Dr. Kruegers old classmates back in college. Krueger claims to despise Vincent, but this is likely not the case. For one, he’s spending time drawing his old classmate. And, he can be seen calling Vincent at the end of the 3rd ending. I’m not entirely sure what to make of Vincent, but it’s worth noting that he is actually a character within <a href="https://dino999z.itch.io/vincent-the-secret-of-myers" class="size">another of dino999z’s games</a>, also on itch.io.

                <h2>ENDINGS</h2>
                <p class="size">
                    There’s three endings to the game. The Bad Ending (1st Ending), the Bad (True?) Ending (2nd ending), and the Good (True) Ending (3rd ending). It’s realistic to be able to reach all of these endings within ~40-45 minutes of gameplay, give or take. Each ending has its own criteria:
                    
                </p>
                <p class="size">
                    1st Ending: You don’t do perfect on Dr. Krueger’s tests, but you don’t completely bomb them, either. You’re overall just mediocre. In this ending, Taylor is sacrificed to feed the people of the G2 district.
  
                </p>

                <p class="size">
                    2nd Ending: Do perfectly on each of Dr. Krueger’s tests. You’re given the option to load back to the beginning of the tests after playing through the game once, so it’s not terribly difficult. In this ending, Taylor is turned into a dream eater by Dr. Krueger.

                <p class="size">
                    3rd Ending: Fail every test, and disobey Dr. Krueger wherever possible. Then, during the Rorschach test, flip over every piece of paper. On the final inkblot, there will be an illustration of Vincent. The game will shut itself off. You have to reboot it to continue. Dr. Krueger apologizes for the outburst, Taylor offers a few kind words, and recommends that Krueger gives his old college arch-enemy a call sometime. Dr. Krueger reluctantly agrees and they bid each other farewell, with Dr. Krueger offering to stay in touch with Taylor. Taylor wakes up from a strange dream, and there's a new .txt file on their desktop. Honestly, a strangely wholesome ending? I loved it.

                <h2>DIFFICULTY</h2>
                <p class="size">
                    The game wasn’t terribly difficult, nor was it very grind-y. As I said previously, all endings can be attained with just around 45 minutes of gameplay. The hardest part was specifically trying to get the cup-and-ball test to be perfect for the 2nd Ending. The cups move almost imperceptibly fast on the last round. But, the load button is there for a reason. I still managed to get it within 5 minutes, though, so no biggie. If you're just trying to play through it once and be done (not recommended), it won't take more than 20 minutes, and it's pretty straightforward.

                <h2>MY THOUGHTS</h2>
                <p class="size">
                    I had a blast with this. As I said before, the general aesthetic of the game was pleasing. The music added to this, as well. There were lots of neat little touches made, as well. For example, replaying the game prompts Taylor to say something about how the routine they’re going through feels familiar. This is something I really dig. It’s reminiscent of Toby Fox’s UNDERTALE, which is a game I could praise for hours on end. It has a lot of freaky save file stuff.

                    <figcaption>Taylor recalls past saves. I love when games do stuff like this. It's like a crazy fourth-wall break. Genuinely so much fun I never get sick of it.</figcaption>

                <p class="size">
                    The dialogue was fun and felt relatively natural. It was kind of awkward, but it was meant to be awkward. Dr. Krueger isn’t exactly a human person, so it makes sense for his dialogue to be strange at some parts. I thought the way the characters bounced off each other way super fun. Taylor knowing that Dr. Krueger is a bit strange, and him trying to shut them down. It was pretty humorous sometimes. I like these characters a whole lot, despite the short length of the game.

                    The scare factor just wasn’t there for me, but it might be partially because I’ve played through plenty of other spooky games and watched other scary videos before. This isn’t to say that the atmosphere wasn’t well done, though. It was executed very well, I think. There’s lots of subtle little details you might only notice after a few plays. For example, the look of the office changes a lot throughout the game. A phone and lamp appear on Krueger’s desk, and the paintings in the background change shape as well. There might have very well been other changes that I didn’t notice. My personal favorite was during the ball game. If you select the cup in the middle, you can see that the sprite of Dr. Krueger sitting at his desk has begun to distort a bit. I thought that was awesome, I felt like I was really cool and observant for noticing.

                    There’s a whole lot more I could say about this game. More about the characters and story and just my own thoughts and theories. But I won’t for the sake of brevity. Well… relative brevity. I’ve already yapped on enough, haven’t I? But I digress. The game was a blast, I might have to check out dino99z’s other game(s?) on itch.io. I give it 5 stars out of 5. Fun game, nice to look at, awesome little experience.
