                    this page was made for my DIGIT100 class. i'm a novice at web development and I've been bumbling through this with very minimal knowledge. i like to think I'm doing alright, but there's always room for improvement. so far, though, i've been having a blast with this. i want to make more things like this for my own personal use later on.
