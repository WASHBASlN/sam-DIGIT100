                <h2>Corpus Analysis of the Warriors Superedition books by Erin Hunter.</h2>
                <p class="size">The auther Erin Hunter is not actually a person, but rather several
                    different people operating under the same pseudonym. I am curious to see if
                    their writing styles vary or not. Of the 14 books I've collected for this
                    analysis, all of them were either written by Kate Cary or Cherith Baldry. Dan
                    Jolley was credited once, alongside Cherith Baldry for the writing of
                    Bramblestar's Storm.</p>
                <p class="size">Bluestar's Prophecy, Crookedstar's Promise, Leopardstar's Honor,
                    Moth Flight's Vision, Squirrelflight's Hope, Tallstar's Revenge, and
                    Tigherheart's Shadow were all written by Kate Cary.</p>
                <p class="size">Bramblestar's Storm, Crowfeather's Trial, Firestar's Quest,
                    Graystripe's Vow, Hawkwing's Journey, SkyClan's Destiny, and Yellowfang's Secret
                    were written by Cherith Baldry.</p>
                <p class="size">All of this information was available to me on the <a
                        href="https://warriors.fandom.com/wiki/Warriors_Wiki" class="size">Warrior
                        Cats Fandom Wiki</a> by simply searching for each book by name.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div">
                <p class="size">First thing, I went in and simply compared the texts at a very face
                    value. I set the N-gram size to 5, because I feel like that's a good, solid
                    number. Anything less that that was basically the same. Anything more would
                    typically bring up lines of dialogue that are frequently repeated, so this is
                    not an indication of the author's writing style.</p>

                <p class="size">While there are some slight differences in their writing styles and word choices it seems, the writing is simple and repetitive enough that a reader likely would not notice the difference. On one had, this makes sense, because they'd probably like to uphold the Erin Hunter persona. But at the same time, there is the background knowledge and context that, historically, the Erins have not been too good at keeping track of the books. One character died 3 different times or something like that because they forgot they already killed him and brought him back.</p>
                <p class="size">It was interesting to look at this. I probably would've gone more in-depth if this wasn't supposed to be a quick little assignment and also if AntConc stopped crashing every time I tried to do one little thing. I'm a bit interested to see how similar the writing is in main series books, since the Super Editions are kind of like side books. </p>
