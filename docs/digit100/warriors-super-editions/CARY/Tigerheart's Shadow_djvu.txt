PROLOGUE 


The black tom had had this dream 
before. It was a dream of a forest, one 
that he had never visited in his waking 
life, and whose silence was unnerving to 
a cat who had grown up surrounded by 
Thunderpaths. As the dream took shape 
around him, he felt pine needles beneath 
his paws, and musty scents filled his 
nose. A thick bramble wall enclosed the 
clearing he stood in. It was swollen here 
and there by dens that seemed to have 
been woven into it. Cats squeezed in and 
out of them. Some crossed the clearing; 
some stopped to talk to one another; 


others padded eagerly toward a pile of 
prey at the far end, sometimes walking 
right by the black tom as if they didn’t 
see him. 

Because they didn’t. He wasn’t 
really there. 

He’d seen these same cats each time 
he visited the dream, and he was 
learning to recognize their pelts. Now a 
brown tom with white splotches and 
light blue eyes carried a bundle of 
fragrant-smelling leaves toward one of 
the dens. A skinny old tom slid out to 
greet him. “I’m glad you’ve come.” The 
old cat nudged him inside. “He’s been 
coughing all night.” 

At the other side of the clearing, a 


tortoiseshell she-cat murmured anxiously 
to a large ginger tom. A pure white she- 
cat watched, her pelt ruffled. Behind 
them, three young cats shifted their paws 
uneasily. 

The dreaming tom pricked his ears. 
These cats have never been this 
worried in their lives . . . and they don t 
know what to do. 

Anxiety was fluttering in his belly. 
Why did he dream of this place? What 
did it mean? As he wondered this, the 
forest blurred around him. The ground 
seemed to shift beneath his paws; then 
suddenly it fell away, and he swirled 
into darkness. 

Stars spun around him until, with a 


jolt, he felt solid ground beneath his 
paws again. Soft green meadows rolled 
away from him on every side. Above 
him, a wide blue sky stretched to the 
distant horizon. 

More cats. The dreaming tom 
blinked as he saw ranks of cats lined 
before him, their pelts sparkling with 
starlight and their eyes flashing eagerly. 
They were staring straight at him. His 
belly tightened with alarm. “How ... 
how can you see me?” 

A black she-cat stepped forward and 
dipped her head. Her fur was sleek, her 
frame well-muscled, as though she’d 
never known the hardships of hunger or 
cold. “Don’t be frightened,” she told him 


softly. “We mean you no harm.” 

A broad-shouldered dark tabby tom 
joined her. “We need you to do 
something for us.” 

“What can J do?” The dreaming tom 
stared at her. “I’m not like you cats... .” 

“You take care of those around you, 
don’t you?” the black she-cat asked. 

“I do what I can to ease their illness 
and heal their wounds.” 

The she-cat blinked slowly. “A cat 
who cares for others is special to us,” 
she mewed. “That is why we chose you 
to be our messenger.” 

“Strangers will come to your home,” 
the broad-shouldered tabby chimed in. 
“They will need your help, just as we 


need it.” 

Puzzled, the dreaming tom frowned. 
“And you need me to give them a 
message?” 

“Not exactly,” the black cat meowed 
quickly. “But let these strangers guide 
your paws.” 

The dreaming tom’s gaze drifted past 
the she-cat to the starry cats gathered 
behind her. Their eyes were fixed on 
him, burning with need. He backed 
away, his heart quickening. Why had 
they chosen him? “I don’t understand.” 

“Please!” The black she-cat’s mew 
was tinged with fear. “If you don’t 
help .. .” Then her voice trailed away, 
and the vision of the starry cats and 


meadows began to dissolve into 
darkness. In its place the dreaming tom 
saw the forest clearing once more. But 
the bramble walls were torn, the dens 
ripped open. The tortoiseshell she-cat 
lay at the head of the clearing, blood 
oozing from wounds scarring her pelt. 
The three young cats he’d seen stumbled 
past. One collapsed, a gash showing 
across his belly. The old tom lay panting 
beside shredded branches. A brown cat 
was sitting nearby, so thin that his bones 
showed though his thin pelt. His pale 
blue eyes stared desolately at the fallen 
cats as though he were frozen to stone by 
their suffering. 

With a jolt, the dreaming tom woke. 


The first thing he felt was the weight of 
the small tom-kit sleeping in the curve of 
his belly. He lifted his head and blinked 
into the darkness, his heart pounding. 
The kit whimpered and twitched, clearly 
having a dream of his own. 

He wondered, just for a moment, if it 
was a similar dream. 

“Rest, little one.” The tom leaned 
down and soothed the kit with a soft lap 
of his tongue. His dream lingered, 
unsettling him. Zf you don t help... The 
black she-cat’s frightened words stuck in 
his mind. He tried to tell himself it was 
just a meaningless voice in his head. 
And yet he couldn’t shake the feeling that 
it was important. . . . He’d dreamed of 


the brambled clearing before, but his 
dream had never shifted to the dark 
place of starry cats. He wondered if it 
meant something. As the kit quieted and 
relaxed once more into deep sleep, the 
tom stared into the shadowy night. 
Dreams are just dreams. He tried to 
dismiss it. But this dream had felt too 
real to be ignored. 





CHAPTER 1 
Cog 


Worry pricked at Tigerhearts paws as 
he bounded between the pines, moving 
so fast he barely caught their scent. 

I have to reach Dovewing. . . . 

He leaped over ragged roots, his tail 
slapping against tree trunks and his legs 
battering the long grass. His pelt 
prickled with anticipation, and his belly 
fur tingled with nerves. 

He always grew tense when he got 
too far away from ShadowClan. It was 
still struggling to rebuild itself in the 
aftermath of the rogue leader Darktail’s 
meddling—first tempting away its 


younger members, then challenging 
Rowanstar for the leadership. 
ShadowClan had turned on its leader 
and chosen to follow the rogue. 
Rowanstar, Tawnypelt, and Tigerheart 
had abandoned the camp to Darktail and 
his “Kin,” and Darktail had proved 
himself even more brutal and vicious 
than Tigerheart could ever have 
imagined. Many ShadowClan cats had 
died or gone missing. Then RiverClan 
suffered as Darktail took his war to 
them. Eventually, all of the Clans joined 
together in fighting back, but even now, 
Tigerheart could not let himself relax. 
He was constantly worried that danger 
was out there somewhere. 


Today, though, his biggest worry was 
that Dovewing wouldn’t wait for him. 

He skidded down the slippery rise 
and jumped a ditch. The sun was starting 
to sink. 

I miss her. I got too used to seeing 
her every day, he admitted to himself. 

When Darktail’s rogues had driven 
them from their Clan, Tigerheart, 
Rowanstar, and Tawnypelt had sought 
sanctuary with ThunderClan. Living 
beside Dovewing every day, he’d felt 
the love he’d once tried to leave behind 
flaring anew. At first she’d kept her 
distance, but he knew that her old 
feelings had been stirred, just as his had 
been. And when they were sent on a 


quest to find Twigpaw, they grew closer 
than they’d ever been. 

After ShadowClan had reclaimed its 
old territory, they’d made an agreement 
to meet—whenever they could—in the 
dappled glade on SkyClan land, just 
beyond the place where the ShadowClan 
and ThunderClan borders touched. 

Tigerheart knew he was being 
disloyal to his Clan. He had told 
Rowanstar that he was going to patrol 
the border, and instead he was meeting 
Dovewing. The lie still felt sour on his 
tongue. Dishonesty was the last thing his 
Clan needed right now. Rowanstar had 
lost confidence in his leadership, and 
with so few cats, the whole Clan was 


stretched to its limit just keeping up 
hunting patrols and border patrols, let 
alone fortifying the camp against harsh 
leaf-bare weather. Food was scarce, and 
the shattered dens were still not ready 
for the first snow. Rowanstar needed his 
support now more than ever. 

Tigerheart had been trying his best to 
restore his Clan’s confidence by backing 
up his father’s decisions and setting an 
example for his Clanmates, as their 
deputy. But the strain of such 
responsibility was tiring. Being with 
Dovewing let him forget his troubles for 
a while. With her, there was no need to 
carry the weight of his Clan. He could 
let the burden slip from his shoulders 


and simply be himself. Once he reached 
her, the anxious tingling in his paws 
would disappear. 

Ears pricked, he rounded a bramble 
patch and crossed a stretch of withered 
ferns. His heart quickened as he 
imagined Dovewing scanning the forest, 
hoping to catch a glimpse of him. A purr 
rumbled in his throat. He was nearly 
there, the misty forest air slicking his 
pelt. Please still be waiting! 

He raced up the slope to where the 
trees thinned. Ahead, sunshine seeped 
through the mist and lit the sheltered 
glade. Beyond the bracken he saw pale 
gray fur. His heart soared. Dovewing. 
Two days apart had been too long. He 


crashed through the damp undergrowth 
and scrambled to a halt beside her. 

Her eyes flashed with relief. “You 
came.” Dovewing thrust her muzzle into 
his neck fur. She was trembling, and he 
thought he could hear a note of worry in 
her mew. 

She was silent so long, apprehension 
spiked through Tigerheart’s fur. “Did 
some cat find out about us?” 

“No.” Dovewing’s ears twitched 
nervously. 

“What is it, then?” Tigerheart stared 
at her blankly. What could be so bad that 
she couldnt find the words? 
“Something’s wrong. I can tell... .” 
Have you stopped loving me? He 


braced himself. 

“Tm expecting kits.” 

Kits? Shock numbed him. “Mine?” 
He wasn’t thinking straight. 

“Of course yours!” Fury flared in 
Dovewing’s eyes. She lifted a paw to 
bat at his muzzle. 

He barely felt it. He was too 
shocked by what she’d said. Kits... our 
kits! 

He took a deep breath to gather 
himself—the last thing Dovewing 
needed was him gawking at thin air. 

“That was a dumb thing to say. I’m 
sorry. You just . . . took me by surprise.” 
Then the tingling of joy he’d been 
starting to feel began to fade. “Have you 


told Ivypool?” Dovewing had always 
been close to her sister. 

“TIvypool barely talks to me these 
days. I think she suspects I’m seeing 
you.” She stared at the ground, her eyes 
full of sadness. Alarm rippled through 
Tigerheart’s pelt, and his breath 
quickened. How could they hide their 
relationship now? What would this 
secret do to ShadowClan? It was 
already so fragile. Cats were bound to 
take sides in a scandal like this. And the 
fallout might destroy the uneasy peace 
that had passed for unity since the rogues 
had left. 

He saw the expectation in 
Dovewing’s gaze shrink to 


disappointment as he stared at her 
wordlessly. His thoughts were spinning, 
but he had no idea what to say. 

She looked away. “This makes things 
so much harder, doesn’t it?” 

Tigerheart shook his head. Having 
kits with Dovewing was something he’d 
dreamed of, and yet . . . “It’s bad timing, 
Dovewing. Our warriors are losing 
respect for Rowanstar. And they keep 
looking at me, like I’m supposed to take 
his place.” 

“Is that what you want?” Dovewing 
stared at him with wide eyes. 

Tigerheart shifted his paws, trying to 
find the right words. “ShadowClan is 
weaker than it’s ever been. They need a 


leader they can believe in.” 

Dovewing inhaled sharply. “And that 
leader has to be you?” 

“I don’t know.” Tigerheart stared at 
the grass beneath his feet. “I’m trying to 
support Rowanstar, but that might not be 
enough.” 

“What about me?” Dovewing’s mew 
caught in her throat. “What about us?” 

Tigerheart felt his heart breaking. 
There must be an us. I’ve struggled too 
long without you... “I love you, 
Dovewing. I will always love you. We 
can sort this out, I promise.” 

Raising his head, he cleared away 
the choking thoughts of Clanmates and 
responsibility and gazed at Dovewing. 


He could see her belly growing already 
and imagined the tiny kits inside. A purr 
broke from his throat. Our kits. He 
weaved around her, letting his purr throb 
through his whole body and hers. “Our 
kits will be beautiful and brave. They 
will grow into fine warriors.” 

As he spoke, hope flickered in his 
chest. Perhaps this was meant to be— 
perhaps these new kits would help 
restore ShadowClan to its former 
strength. “You can join ShadowClan 
with me. We could be together. There 
would be no more hiding or lying, and 
we could bring up our kits in the same 
Clan.” It seemed the perfect solution. 
His belly tingled with apprehension, but 


he hoped that she would be excited 
about raising their shared kin in the pine 
forest. It might take her a little while to 
get used to ShadowClan’s ways, but 
she’d be so well cared for, he knew she 
could be happy there. 

He knew they could be happy there. 

His thoughts were tumbling so fast 
over one another, he hardly felt her 
freeze. Only when he pressed his muzzle 
against her cheek did he realize that 
she’d become as stiff as stone. 

“I can’t do that.” She stared at the 
ground, defeat heavy in her gaze. 

“I know it will be hard, but 
Dovewing, it might be the best thing for 
the kits.” Tigerheart tried to catch her 


eye. “The best thing for us.” And for 
ShadowClan. 

Slowly she lifted her gaze. Fear 
shimmered in her eyes. “I wish I could 
believe that,’ she began haltingly. 
“But... ve been having dreams.” 

“Dreams?” Tigerheart struggled to 
understand. Dovewing wasn’t a 
medicine cat. She’d lost her special 
powers moons ago when the Dark Forest 
had been beaten. “All cats have 
dreams.” 

“Not like these.” Dovewing’s gaze 
glittered unnervingly. Whatever she was 
about to say, she believed strongly. 
“These dreams mean something. I can 
feel it.” 


Tigerheart’s pelt prickled with 
alarm. “Are they... bad dreams?” 

“I dream of the ThunderClan nursery. 
I’m alone in the camp, and I’m watching 
the nursery from the clearing. Something 
feels wrong, so I go to look inside.” The 
fur along her spine lifted as she 
remembered. “It’s empty. The nests are 
old and tattered, and shadows are 
creeping from the corners. They 
swallow the floor and the nests. I run 
outside, but the shadows follow. They 
reach through the entrance like dark 
flames and lick the walls, growing 
darker and stronger until the whole 
nursery is lost in blackness.” 

As she spoke, Tigerheart felt like he 


could see everything she described, so 
clearly. He had to shake his head to 
chase the images out of his head. “It’s 
just a dream,” he told her, not sure if he 
believed it himself. 

Dovewing drew away. “But it’s 
not!” Her mew was taut with fear. “I 
have it again and again, and every time I 
do, I wake up filled with dread because 
I know it’s a sign.” 

Tigerheart blinked at her. The fear in 
her eyes was real, but he tried to tell 
himself it was just because she’d been 
worrying about this by herself for so 
long. She could share the worry with 
him now. “Have you asked Jayfeather or 
Alderheart about it?” 


“How could I?” Dovewing lashed 
her tail. “They might guess.” She glared 
down at her swelling flanks. “Ive been 
expecting for a moon and it’s starting to 
show. They may have already guessed 
I'm expecting kits. Telling them I’m 
having dreams about the nursery will 
just confirm it!” 

Tigerheart tried to make his voice 
sound bright. “If a medicine cat believes 
that nursery dreams are normal, perhaps 
they are.” 

“Not like this!” Dovewing hissed. 

“Well, you could ask them if they’ ve 
had any signs from StarClan.” Tigerheart 
was starting to feel exasperated. Why 
was Dovewing so sure her dreams were 


special? “Maybe they’ve had a sign that 
will explain your dream. They’re 
medicine cats, after all. You aren’t.” 

“I don’t need a medicine cat to 
explain my dream!” Dovewing’s eyes 
flashed with frustration. “I know what it 
means. It means our kits mustn’t be born 
in ThunderClan!” 

Tigerheart fluffed out his pelt 
eagerly. “So ... maybe you’re meant to 
join ShadowClan! That’s great. I know 
you'll be happy with us. Don’t worry 
about any cat’s reaction, either. No cat 
has time right now to get mad at having a 
ThunderClan cat in camp. And if we 
bring new kits, new life, to ShadowClan, 
then every cat will be happy, because 


we'll be making ShadowClan stronger.” 

“No.” Dovewing glowered at him. 
“Tm not raising our kits in ShadowClan. 
Believe me, I’ve thought about that, and I 
know it’s what you want, but . . . That’s 
not what’s right for us either.” Tigerheart 
forced his pelt to smooth. Neither 
ThunderClan nor ShadowClan? What, 
then, was she thinking about? 

Dovewing’s mew was firm. “We 
have to leave the Clans.” 

Stunned, Tigerheart stared at her 
wordlessly. Leave the Clans? 

“We have to.” Dovewing dug her 
paws into the earth. “I’ve dreamed 
where we should go. A huge 
Twolegplace with nests that reach into 


the sky. I saw a roof there with sharp 
points that stick up into the sky like 
gorse spines. We must find that den. Our 
kits will be safe there.” 

Tigerheart’s pelt bristled with anger. 
“This is nonsense!” He met her gaze. 
“Why would our kits be safer in a 
strange Twolegplace? How can we raise 
them away from their Clans? Our Clans 
are what keep us all safe!” 

Dovewing narrowed her eyes. “The 
Clans are a mess! So many cats have 
died fighting for territory lately, who’s to 
say there will even be Clans a few 
moons from now?” 

“So you want us to run away?” 
Tigerheart could hardly believe this was 


happening. “You want to abandon your 
Clanmates? You want to bring up our 
kits so they never know their kin or the 
warrior code?” 

“No!” Desperation sharpened 
Dovewing’s mew. “I don’t want any of 
this! I just know we must go. The dreams 
come every night. I don’t just see them; I 
feel them. If I ignore what they tell me, I 
fear that something terrible will happen 
to our kits!” 

Tigerheart turned in an anxious 
circle, his thoughts fighting one another. 

“This isn’t a choice for me.” 
Dovewing’s mew hardened. “It’s what I 
must do.” 

Tigerheart felt sick. “I can’t just 


leave.” 

Dovewing’s eyes were stricken with 
panic. Tigerheart looked away. His 
forepaws twitched, as if ready to walk 
with her as far away from here as she 
wanted to go. But his hindquarters felt 
heavy, like they wanted to pin him to the 
ground so that he could never leave 
ShadowClan. He yearned to be with her, 
but he was afraid to abandon his father 
when things were so terrible. It made 
him feel like his body might be torn in 
two. 

“Tigerheart!” She sounded anxious. 

He felt her breath on his cheek and 
forced himself to look at her. 

“I don’t want to do this without you, 


1? 


Tigerheart!” Her mew was shaky. “I 
need you.” 

“ShadowClan needs me,” Tigerheart 
mewed desperately. “Rowanstar can’t 
lead without my help. You’re right— 
ShadowClan’s a mess. If I leave, it may 
not survive.” 

“Then stay!” Dovewing’s green eyes 
flashed with rage. “If your Clan is more 
important to you than your kits, stay with 
them. I’m going.” She backed away from 
him, grief twisting her face. “My Clan 
can look after itself. Pm protecting my 
kits.” 

“Dovewing!” Desperation spiked 
Tigerheart’s pelt. “We’ll be better able 
to protect our kits if we stay with our 


Clans.” 

She held his gaze. “I’m leaving in 
three days. If you want to leave with me, 
meet me here. If not, I. . .” Her tail 
bushed, and she looked at the ground 
briefly. Whatever she had to tell him 
next seemed hard for her to say. “I will 
go without you.” 

Then she turned and pushed her way 
through the undergrowth. 

Tigerheart stared after her, his heart 
beating so loudly in his ears that it 
drowned the sound of birdsong. A gust 
of wind sent the mist swirling among the 
trees and rocked their branches. He felt 
dizzy. Dovewing had given him an 
impossible choice. She needed him. His 


unborn kits needed him. But so did 
ShadowClan. Who needs me the most? 





CHAPTER 2 
Cog 


Can I leave? Should I stay? 

Two days had passed since 
Dovewing’s ultimatum, and still 
Tigerheart’s thoughts chased around his 
head like kittens trying to catch their 
own tails. He had one more day to make 
up his mind, but the right decision felt 
like a piece of prey he just could not 
catch. What am I going to do? 

“Tigerheart?” Grassheart’s mew 
shook him from his thoughts. 

He turned his gaze distractedly 
toward her and found the pale brown 
tabby blinking at him. “We’re supposed 


to be hunting, right?” Irritation edged her 
mew. 

“Yes.” Tigerheart shook out his pelt. 
“Sorry. I was thinking about something 
else.” 

“Think later. Our Clanmates are 
hungry.” Grassheart sniffed and cast her 
sharp gaze around the forest. “We need 
to take something back to the fresh-kill 
pile. Have you noticed the way 
Ratscar’s ribs are sticking through his 
pelt?” 

Guilt dropped like another stone in 
Tigerheart’s belly. His Clanmates were 
hungry. Dovewing was expecting kits. 
His father was struggling to regain the 
respect of their Clan. He should be able 


to fix everything, but he couldn’t even 
focus on catching prey. 

Snowbird’s white pelt showed 
between the withering ferns a few tail- 
lengths away. The she-cat was sniffing 
the pine-strewn earth. “I think I’ve 
picked up a rabbit trail.” 

Grassheart hurried to her side. “How 
fresh is it?” 

“Fresh enough.” Snowbird began to 
creep away from the ferns, her tail-tip 
twitching with excitement. AS 
Grassheart shadowed her, Tigerheart 
glanced toward the SkyClan border. He 
could smell their scent where it marked 
the pines at the top of the rise. Had he 
made the right decision when he 


suggested SkyClan should take some of 
ShadowClan’s land? There might be 
more prey if they had more space to 
hunt. And yet how could they spare the 
cats needed to cover so much territory? 
He flicked his tail. It had been the right 
thing to do. SkyClan needed a home. 
And after all the problems the Clans had 
had with the rogues, maybe StarClan 
would look favorably on cats who 
spread kindness where there had been 
fear and mistrust. He just wished his 
Clanmates thought the same. But 
Scorchfur, Snowbird, and Stonewing had 
made it clear that they were not going to 
pretend they were content to give up 
land to another Clan. Tigerheart closed 


his eyes as fresh worries crowded his 
thoughts. 

Above him, thrushes sounded like 
they were having their own arguments 
over territory. A cold wind rustled the 
branches. Grassheart and Snowbird 
were out of sight now, tracking the 
rabbit. As Tigerheart turned to follow 
them, paw steps thrummed at the top of 
the rise. 

“Hey, Tigerheart!’’ Sandynose stood 
at the SkyClan border, Rabbitleap 
beside him. Their pelts were ruffled and 
their eyes bright. Sandynose’s flanks 
heaved. “The squirrels in this forest are 
fast!” He glanced at the trunk of the pine 
beside him. A tail bobbed upward and 


p? 


disappeared among the branches. 

Rabbitleap dipped his head politely 
to Tigerheart. “I hope you’re having 
better luck than us.” 

“Not yet,”  Tigerheart mewed 
heavily. Did luck have anything to do 
with it? Perhaps if he were a better 
warrior, he’d be able to feed his Clan 
single-pawed. If he were a better son, 
Rowanstar wouldn’t be so overwhelmed 
by leadership. If he were a better mate— 

Small paws thumped the ground. 

Grassheart’s urgent mew sounded 
through the trees. “Prey!” 

Tigerheart stiffened as a rabbit raced 
past him, shooting up the rise so fast he 
didn’t have time to untangle himself from 


his thoughts and give chase. It hared 
across the border, a tail-length from 
Sandynose. 

The SkyClan tom ran after it. Pelt 
bristling with excitement, Rabbitleap 
raced after him. 

Tigerheart froze. He’d let prey fall 
into another Clan’s paws. 

“You mouse-brain!” Grassheart 
thundered to a halt beside him. “Why 
didn’t you catch it?” 

Snowbird caught up to them, eyes 
sparking with anger. “We drove it 
straight toward you!” She shot a look at 
Grassheart. “I thought Rowanstar was 
the unreliable one.” 

“Like father, like son,’ Grassheart 


snorted crossly. 

“That’s not fair!’ Tigerheart shot 
back. “Rowanstar could outhunt any of 
you, and I was distracted—” 

He realized the two she-cats had 
stopped listening. They were looking up 
the deserted slope. Their noses twitched. 

“I smell SkyClan.” Snowbird curled 
her lip at Tigerheart. “Is that what 
distracted you? Were there SkyClan cats 
here?” 

“I was talking to Sandynose and 
Rabbitleap,” Tigerheart confessed. He 
wished that was all that had been 
distracting him. 

Grassheart frowned as she stared at 
the churned pine needles where the 


rabbit had scrambled to the top of the 
slope. “And you let our prey run right 
into their paws,” she growled. 

Irritation rippled beneath 
Tigerheart’s pelt. He’d had enough of 
trying to persuade his Clanmates that 
having SkyClan as neighbors would 
make them safer, not weaker. He was 
tired of making excuses for Rowanstar. 
He was tired of chasing prey that 
preferred other Clans’ land. Maybe 1 
should leave with Dovewing! Dovewing 
made him happy. She needed him, and so 
did their kits. And he loved her. 

Pine needles swished at the top of 
the rise. Sandynose and Rabbitleap 
appeared at the border. The fat rabbit 


Tigerheart had missed was dangling 
from Sandynose’s jaws. 

Snowbird hissed, her eyes glittering 
with fury. “Have you come to gloat with 
our prey?” 

Sandynose tossed the dead rabbit 
down the slope. “We came to return it.” 
He glared haughtily at the white she-cat. 

Snowbird bristled. “We don’t need 
you to hunt for us!” 

Tigerheart caught her eye, warning 
her to be quiet. When a Clan was hungry, 
pride was sometimes worth swallowing. 

Grassheart padded toward the rabbit 
and glanced back at Snowbird. “Ratscar 
will be grateful for the meal.” 

Snowbird narrowed her eyes. 


Tigerheart looked at her expectantly. 
Surely she could smell the warmth of its 
blood? Wasn’t she hungry enough to 
accept SkyClan’s kindness? Tigerheart’s 
belly ached with hunger. He hadn’t eaten 
since sunhigh yesterday. 

Grassheart turned her gaze to him. 
“We should take it.” 

Tigerheart nodded. “It would have 
been our catch if Pd been quicker.” 

As Snowbird growled under her 
breath, Grassheart dipped her head to 
Sandynose and Rabbitleap. “It was kind 
of you to return the prey.” 

Sandynose bowed stiffly and turned 
away. Wordlessly, the SkyClan warriors 
padded from the border. 


Snowbird sniffed. “They’re almost 
as smug as ThunderClan.” 

“They were being generous,” 
Grassheart pointed out. 

Tigerheart’s pelt prickled hotly. 
Another Clan had killed prey that he 
should have caught. He tried to ignore 
his shame. At least this was a chance to 
persuade Snowbird that giving SkyClan 
their land had been a good idea. ““We’re 
lucky to have such honorable warriors 
close by.” 

Snowbird headed back toward the 
ferns, her tail twitching. “Only you could 
see luck in losing half our territory,” she 
grumbled. 

Grassheart rolled her eyes at him. 


“She’ll be fine once she sees Ratscar 
eating this.” She scooped up the rabbit 
and headed toward home. 


Tigerheart scanned the clearing as he 
led Grassheart and Snowbird into camp. 
“Where’s Ratscar?” he called to 
Whorlpaw, who was sharing tongues 
with Flowerpaw at the edge. There was 
no sign of the skinny elder. 

Whorlpaw looked up. “He’s doing 
border patrol with Juniperclaw.” 

Tigerheart blinked. Elders weren’t 
supposed to go on border patrol. 

Scorchfur was at the fresh-kill pile. 
“I offered to take his place, but he said 
there were so few cats in ShadowClan 
now, he should help.” His gaze flicked 


to the rabbit Grassheart was carrying. 
“Nice catch.” He looked hopefully at 
Snowbird. “Any more where that came 
from?” 

“We’ll go out again soon,” 
Tigerheart promised. He glanced at 
Rowanstar and Tawnypelt at the head of 
the clearing. They were talking, their 
pelts prickling anxiously. Shouldn’t they 
be leading a hunting patrol? Talking 
wasn’t going to save the Clan. 

The bramble entrance  rustled. 
Tigerheart turned, surprised to see 
Juniperclaw leading Willowshine and 
Alderheart into the camp. He pricked his 
ears. It was strange to have the 
ThunderClan medicine cat here, even 


stranger to see RiverClan’s. Mistystar 
had been determined to restore her 
Clan’s strength and had decided, after 
the last Gathering, that she should close 
its borders. So why was Willowshine 
roaming outside her territory? 

Ratscar followed them in, his mangy 
old pelt rippling with unease. 

Tigerheart sat down in the shadow of 
the rock and watched the two medicine 
cats approach Rowanstar. They looked 
worried. Did they bring news from 
StarClan? Perhaps they’d had a vision as 
ominous as Dovewing’s dreams. 
Perhaps Alderheart had noticed that she 
was expecting kits. He searched the 
ThunderClan tom’s gaze, looking for a 


sign that Alderheart knew more than he 
should, but Alderheart was staring at 
Rowanstar as Willowshine spoke. 

“Tve had a vision. We need to find a 
cat with an extra claw,” she told the 
ShadowClan leader. “It’s the only way 
to fend off the coming storm.” 

“Do you know any cats with six 
toes?” Alderheart leaned forward, his 
gaze fixing more intently on Rowanstar. 

No visions of shadows swallowing 
the ThunderClan nursery. No hint that 
Dovewing was expecting kits. 
Tigerheart’s thoughts drifted. Should 1 
be relieved? If the medicine cats hadn’t 
shared Dovewing’s dream, maybe she 
was wrong. This new prophecy about a 


six-toed cat might be enough to show her 
that her dream was just a dream. If it 
was something more, then StarClan 
would have shared it with the medicine 
cats, not just her. 

Scorchfur’s sharp mew hooked him 
from his thoughts. “How can we send out 
a search party? We have barely enough 
cats to patrol our borders.” 

Rowanstar dipped his head in 
agreement. “The SkyClan border can’t 
be left unguarded.” 

Anxiety pricked Tigerheart’s belly. 
How could he leave a Clan that didn’t 
even have enough cats for a search 
party? There must be some way to 
persuade Dovewing to stay. He pictured 


meeting her at sunset tomorrow. What 
could he say to make her see that they 
would be safer raising kits with their 
Clans, beside the lake? And yet he 
couldn’t shake the worry that maybe she 
was right: Darktail had nearly destroyed 
them. Perhaps the Clans were no longer 
strong enough to protect their kits. 

An angry hiss jerked him from his 
thoughts. Scorchfur and Tawnypelt were 
facing each other, eyes blazing with fury. 

“Why do you think we chose a rogue 
over Rowanstar?” Scorchfur snarled. 
“He was a weak leader then; he’s a 
weak leader now.” 

Tawnypelt’s fur bushed. Spitting, she 
sliced her claws across her Clanmate’s 


muzzle. 

Tigerheart froze. What was 
happening? Why was his Clan fighting 
itself? As he watched, Scorchfur swung 
his claws at Tawnypelt’s face. 

Tawnypelt ducked away, yowling 
with pain. 

Her eye! Panic sparked Tigerheart 
into action. With a yowl, he threw 
himself between the fighting cats. He 
shoved Scorchfur away from Tawnypelt 
and shielded her, hissing. 

Rowanstar stared, his gaze stricken 
with shock. 

Tigerheart turned to face Tawnypelt. 
“Are you okay?” He gasped at the blood 
welling beside his mother’s eye. He felt 


fur brush his flank as Puddleshine slid in 
beside him and gently eased him out of 
the way. 

What in StarClan had they been 
fighting about? Dazed with shock, 
Tigerheart turned. Alderheart and 
Willowshine were hurrying out of camp. 
Scorchfur had backed to the edge of the 
clearing. 

Rowanstar stared at the dark gray 
tom with undisguised contempt. “How 
can we trust a Clanmate who turns on his 
own so easily?” 

Scorchfur glared back at him. “How 
can we trust a leader who gives up on 
his Clan at the first sign of threat?” 

Tigerheart’s gaze flitted from the two 


toms back to his mother. Puddleshine 
was quickly lapping the blood beside 
her eye. “It’s only a flesh wound,” he 
reassured her. “Your vision won’t be 
harmed.” 

Relief swept  Tigerheart as 
Puddleshine led Tawnypelt toward the 
medicine den. He could hardly believe 
that one Clanmate had tried to blind 
another. Nothing could be further from 
the warrior code. He’d known tensions 
had been running high, but how had it 
come to this? J should have stopped it. 
If his thoughts hadn’t been wrapped up 
in Dovewing, he might have prevented 
his Clanmates turning on one another. 
Instead I was worrying about whether I 


should leave my Clan. Guilt choked 
him. He pictured Dovewing, waiting, 
frightened and alone, carrying their kits. 
Love seemed to tear his heart into two; 
the pain left him breathless. 

“Tigerheart.” | Puddleshine was 
padding toward him, Rowanstar at his 
heels. 

“Is Tawnypelt all right?” Tigerheart 
met his gaze anxiously. 

Puddleshine nodded. “She’s in my 
den. I put herbs on the wound. She’s 
resting. But I must speak with you and 
your father.” 

Tigerheart frowned. “Why?” 

The medicine cat’s gaze moved from 
father to son, dark with warning. 


“There’s something I must share with 
both of you.” 





CHAPTER 3 
Cog 


Tigerheart glanced uneasily around the 
camp. Was there time to talk with 
Puddleshine? The fight between 
Scorchfur and Tawnypelt must have 
shocked the Clan. Perhaps they should 
be reassuring their Clanmates instead. 
“Snakepaw.” Strikestone waved the 
apprentice closer with a flick of his tail. 
“Come with me. We’re going hunting.” 
He was clearly trying to divert her 
attention from her mentor Tawnypelt’s 
injury, and the tensions within the Clan. 
The honey-brown tabby she-cat 
looked at him eagerly. “Can Whorlpaw 


and Flowerpaw come?” 

Strikestone turned to their mentors, 
Juniperclaw and Scorchfur. “We can 
hunt together. The fresh-kill pile needs 
filling, and the youngsters can practice 
hunting in groups.” He eyed Scorchfur 
warily, as though worried the dark gray 
tom was still enraged enough to claw at 
his Clanmates’ eyes. 

But Scorchfur dipped his head and 
grunted. “Okay.” He beckoned 
Whorlpaw toward the entrance with a 
flick of his muzzle, then padded after 
him as he headed into the forest. 
Flowerpaw and Snakepaw exchanged 
glances, then followed, Juniperclaw at 
their heels, Strikestone just behind him. 


Tigerheart stepped toward the brown 
tabby tom. “Thank you,” he purred. 

Strikestone dipped his head. “Don’t 
mention it,” he said, before joining the 
others on their way out of camp. 

Tigerheart watched them go, 
enjoying the feeling of his anxiety 
draining away. It was good to see the 
warriors working together to diffuse the 
tension and keep the apprentices busy. 
Rowanstar hadn’t even seemed to notice. 
He was staring at Puddleshine. “What do 
you want to tell us?” 

As Puddleshine lifted his chin, 
Tigerheart remembered suddenly how 
young the medicine cat was. In the 
moons since he’d earned his medicine- 


cat name, the young tom had seen so 
much. They all had. It was easy to forget 
that Puddleshine had been trained by 
Leafpool from kit to full medicine cat in 
litle more than a moon. And yet 
Tigerheart trusted him now as much as 
he’d once trusted Littlecloud. He could 
see earnestness in the young tom’s pale 
blue eyes as Puddleshine began to speak. 

“I had a vision this morning. I was 
watching the camp as it woke. The rising 
sun cut through the branches and sent 
long shadows over our Clanmates as 
they climbed out of their dens and began 
to move around the clearing. As I 
watched them padding in and out of the 
shadows, the sun seemed to strengthen. I 


could see it beyond the forest, growing 
fiery, and, as it did, the shadows in the 
camp became longer, darker—” 

“Are you sure this was a vision?” 
Rowanstar looked puzzled. “It sounds 
like any other sunrise.” 

Puddleshine gave a slow nod. “The 
sun shone intensely,” he breathed. “As 
though, at any moment, the whole forest 
might catch fire. And the shadows were 
so dark, it looked as though night had cut 
swaths through the camp. Between the 
shadows, the sunlight was blinding. Not 
like dawn light. It was so bright, I had to 
turn away.” He stopped, shifted his 
paws. “Then, suddenly, the sun dimmed. 
It faded beyond the trees and became so 


weak that it seemed to melt into the pale 
dawn sky. As it did, the shadows faded. 
The fierce stripes that had marked the 
clearing dissolved until no trace of 
shadow was left in camp. For a moment, 
the whole forest was awash in sunlight 
so soft that it was impossible to 
distinguish between light and shade.” 
“The shadows disappeared.” 
Tigerheart breathed the words. He could 
barely imagine it. The camp had always 
been shaped by shadow. Even at 
sunhigh, the pines and brambles marked 
the clearing with patches of darkness. 
Puddleshine blinked at him. “Without 
shadows, what is ShadowClan?”’ 
Tigerheart knew the stories the other 


Clans told of ShadowClan—how 
darkness molded their hearts, how they 
thrived on the power they found in 
shadow where other Clans would 
wither. Of course, they were just nursery 
tales, told to frighten kits, but wasn’t 
there some truth in those stories? To be a 
ShadowClan cat was to grow up in the 
enclosing gloom of the forest, to feel 
hidden and protected by it, to learn to 
move within it and use its cover for 
stealth. “But you said when the vision 
started, the sun was strong.” 

Puddleshine nodded. “And the 
shadows were strong.” 

Rowanstar flicked his tail. “But 
shadows are always strongest when the 


sun is strongest. We’ve always known 
that.” 

Puddleshine stared at him. “The 
vision was sent to remind us that when 
the sun is strong, the shadows are 
strong.” 

Tigerheart’s pelt pricked ominously. 
“And when the sun fades, the shadows 
fade.” 

Puddleshine’s ears twitched 
nervously. “In the vision, the shadows 
disappeared.” 

Tigerheart swallowed. Was 
Puddleshine trying to tell them that 
ShadowClan was going to disappear? 

“But how can we control the sun?” 
Rowanstar looked confused. 


Puddleshine dropped his gaze. 
“Perhaps we don’t have to. I think the 
sun represented something else,” he 
murmured. 

Rowanstar stared at him, his pelt 
prickling irritably. “What could it 
possibly represent?” 

You. Tigerheart stared at his father. 
How could he fail to understand? The 
sun represents you. His throat tightened. 
If Rowanstar was weak, then 
ShadowClan would disappear. Wasn’t 
that what was happening already? He 
pictured Scorchfur’s claw flashing 
toward Tawnypelt’s eye. The Clan was 
crumbling. You have to be strong. The 
words dried on his tongue. How could 


he accuse his father of being weak in 
front of their Clanmates? It would crush 
him. 

He looked hopefully at Puddleshine. 
Perhaps he was going to warn 
Rowanstar. 

“So?” Rowanstar glanced 
impatiently at Puddleshine. “Tell me 
what the sun represents. You're the 
medicine cat. Yowre meant to know 
these things.” 

Tigerheart’s chest tightened. Tell 
him. 

Puddleshine glanced apologetically 
at Rowanstar. “We are being warned that 
ShadowClan may disappear.” 

Tell him that hes the sun! Perhaps 


Puddleshine didn’t realize what the 
vision meant. Or perhaps he believed 
that warning Rowanstar he was weak 
might weaken him further. Tigerheart 
tried to read Puddleshine’s gaze, but he 
saw only worry. 

“What should we do?” Rowanstar 
flicked his tail. 

Tigerheart looked his father in the 
eye. “We must stay strong,” he meowed. 
“As strong as the sun.” 

Rowanstar just looked at him. 
Tigerheart stared back, waiting for the 
ginger tom’s eyes to light up with 
understanding. 

But Rowanstar looked as confused 
as the other cats. Tigerheart wondered if 


maybe he should say something to his 
father. ... 

But won t that make him look weak, 
if he needs his deputy to explain a 
vision to him? 

He turned away, feeling sick. 
Tomorrow, Dovewing was expecting 
him to leave the forest with her. But how 
could he abandon his Clan now, when 
they needed him most? Rowanstar 
clearly needed support. If Tigerheart left 
now, then the shadows would fade. 
ShadowClan would disappear. 

But Dovewing was willing to make 
her journey alone if she had to. He had 
to stop her. Once he’d made sure that 
Rowanstar and ShadowClan were strong 


again, then they could journey wherever 
she wanted to go. 

He ran across the clearing, anxiety 
fizzing in his pelt. He headed for the 
entrance and ducked through the bramble 
tunnel. The damp leaf-fall air seeped 
into his fur as he headed for the 
ThunderClan border. He felt cold. The 
ground felt chilly beneath his paws. He 
had to talk to someone. He had to save 
his Clan. He had to save Dovewing. 

As he neared the border and 
ThunderClan scents began to drift 
between the trees, he slowed. The fear 
that gripped him spiraled into panic. 
What am I doing? He couldn’t reveal 
their secret about the kits! If Dovewing’s 


Clan rejected her, she’d never forgive 
him. She had a plan. He couldn’t ruin it 
by betraying her. 

He stopped. But what if Dovewing 
told a Clanmate about the kits herself? 
What if she felt close enough to another 
cat to confide her fears? 

Ivypool! Of course! The sisters had 
been close until recently. Dovewing had 
complained that her sister hardly spoke 
to her now. She must miss having 
Ivypool to confide in. Jf I can mend 
their relationship, Dovewing might tell 
Ivypool everything. Tigerheart lifted his 
head eagerly. And then Ivypool could 
persuade her to stay. 

Tigerheart snatched desperately at 


the hope. He broke into a run. He had to 
find Ivypool and speak to her! 


Tigerheart crouched beside the 
ThunderClan border until sunset. When 
there was still no sign of Ivypool, he 
crossed it. Slinking through the shadows, 
his mouth open to taste for scents, he 
crept across ThunderClan land. What if 
she was patrolling the far side? Could he 
wait outside the camp until he saw her 
return and catch her attention? 

Anxiety fluttered in his belly. He 
shouldn’t be on ThunderClan territory. 
But he had to see Ivypool. 

Suddenly her scent touched his nose. 
It was fresh. His heart soared. StarClan 
must be guiding us! He scanned the 


shadowy forest. Twilight was sinking 
fast into mght. He widened his eyes, 
trying to glimpse her pelt, and heard 
paws scuff the ground beyond a stand of 
bracken. He caught a scent that tasted 
like Dovewing’s—a little harsher, but 
familiar. Taking a risk, he whispered 
into the shadows. “Ivypool.” 

He heard a sudden movement. Some 
cat had turned quickly. Fur brushed the 
bracken stems. They trembled in front of 
him as Ivypool pushed her way out. 

“Tigerheart?” Hostility gleamed in 
her gaze. “What are you doing here?” 

“I have to talk to you.” 

“To me?” She curled her lip. “Are 
you sure youre not looking for 


Dovewing?” 

“Tm sure.” 

Ivypool growled at him. “Twigpaw 
saw you and my sister meeting near the 
border. You know that’s against the 
warrior code, right? You could get her 
into big trouble.” 

Tigerheart stared into her burning 
gaze. Urgency writhed like captured 
prey in his chest. “I love her, Ivypool, 
and she loves me. But she needs you.” 

Ivypool narrowed her eyes. “Is that 
why you’re here? To tell me that you’re 
in love, so everything’s okay?” Her mew 
dripped with contempt. 

“She says you’re shutting her out,” 
Tigerheart urged. “I know you’re angry 


with her. But she needs someone to 
confide in.” 

“You mean she needs me to approve 
of what she’s doing so she doesn’t feel 


so guilty!” Anger sharpened Ivypool’s 
mew. 

“Don’t you care about her?” 
Tigerheart pleaded. 


Ivypool’s pelt bushed. “How dare 
you?” she spat. “Of course I care about 
her. And if you cared about her, you’d 
leave her alone.” 

“I cant.” Helplessness swamped 
Tigerheart. He wanted to blurt out the 
truth—that Dovewing was expecting 
kits. He wanted the truth to fix 
everything. He wanted Ivypool to 


forgive Dovewing and reassure her that 
raising her kits in the Clans would be 
great. But he knew the truth might make 
things worse. And telling the truth should 
be Dovewing’s choice, not his. 

“Tvypool.” He gazed at her 
desperately. “Just talk to her. Please.” 

“T will.” Ivypool whirled away with 
a snarl. “Once she’s stopped seeing 
you.” Her silver tail lashing, she pushed 
her way through the bracken and 
disappeared into darkness. 

Tigerheart watched her go, his chest 
tightening with panic. Ivypool had been 
his last, desperate hope at persuading 
Dovewing, and now that hope had died. 
Dovewing only had him. J don t want to 


do this without you, Tigerheart. I need 
you. He pictured her wide, stricken 
gaze, and his heart ached. 

He curled his claws into the earth. 
Rowanstar was ShadowClan’s leader; 
he was responsible for the Clan. /ts not 
my duty to hold the Clan together. 
Tigerheart headed for the border. I’ve 
carried that burden for too long. He 
pictured Scorchfur’s snarling face as he 
attacked Tawnypelt. He remembered the 
treachery of the apprentices who’d 
brought the rogues into the Clan. Let 
them hold themselves together. 
Bitterness rose in his throat. Or tear 
themselves apart. Determination pulsed 
through him as he padded through the 


deepening night. My responsibility is to 
Dovewing and my kits. 

I love you, Dovewing, and I wont 
let you down. 





CHAPTER 4 
Cog 


Tigerheart could taste rain on the 
wind. Thick clouds darkened the sky 
above the pines, casting the forest into 
gloom. Not good traveling weather. His 
chest tightened as he thought about 
meeting Dovewing. Sunhigh had passed 
long ago. He must leave soon. She’d be 
waiting. 

He reached up and tucked a stray 
tendril into the bramble wall of the 
ShadowClan nursery. Rowanstar had 
given orders that all the dens be repaired 
and strengthened. Rain was coming, and 
he wanted the Clan to be warm and dry 


in their nests. Grassheart and Strikestone 
were working on the warriors’ den. 
Flowerpaw, Snakepaw, and Whorlpaw 
poked wads of moss into the holes in 
side of their own den, while Tawnypelt 
and Snowbird wove extra brambles into 
the walls of the elders’ den. 

Tigerheart’s throat tightened. Could 
he really leave? This was the only life 
he’d known. Sadness jabbed at his heart. 
He might never see these cats again. 
He’d be leaving the forest to live in a 
Twolegplace! His pelt _ prickled 


nervously. 
Around him, his Clanmates were 
working together, following 


Rowanstar’s orders without question. 


He pushed his doubts away. Dovewing 
needs me more than they do. 

Rowanstar was padding around the 
camp, inspecting the work. He nodded 
approvingly as he passed Whorlpaw, 
slowing to point out a gap near the 
bottom of the wall that still needed 
filling. Whorlpaw dipped his head to the 
ShadowClan leader and quickly reached 
for another wad of moss to plug it. 
Tigerheart’s chest ached with hope. The 
Clan would be fine without him. 

“Tigerheart!” Rowanstar was 
crossing the clearing. 

Tigerheart tensed. What did 
Rowanstar want? He glanced at the 
darkening treetops. He’d been hoping to 


slip away soon. Keeping his fur smooth, 
he tugged two strands of bramble closer 
together before dropping onto all four 
paws to face his father. “Yes?” 

“Take out a hunting party.” 
Rowanstar had stopped beside the fresh- 
kill pile. A thrush and a vole were all 
that was left from the morning’s catch. 

Tigerheart relaxed. Perfect. I can 
slip away easily while I’m in the forest. 

“Take Grassheart, Snowbird, 


Juniperclaw, and Scorchfur.” 
Rowanstar’s green gaze scanned the 
camp. 


Tigerheart followed it. Where were 
Juniperclaw and Scorchfur? Hadn’t they 
been helping Grassheart and Strikestone 


fix up the warriors’ den? Perhaps they 
were outside camp, fetching bracken to 
weave into the den walls. “Pll find 
them,” he told Rowanstar. He beckoned 
Grassheart and Snowbird with his tail as 
he headed for the camp entrance. 

He ducked outside and stopped a 
few tail-lengths from the camp. Opening 
his mouth, he let the musky scents of 
leaf-fall bathe his tongue. He could taste 
the fresh scent of his missing Clanmates, 
but in the misty air it was hard to tell 
which way they’d headed. 

Grassheart stopped beside him. 

“Can you tell which way Scorchfur 
and Juniperclaw went?” he asked her. 

“Don’t worry,” she mewed quickly. 


“We can hunt without them.” 

It’ll be easier for me to slip away 
from a bigger patrol. Tigerheart looked 
at the pale brown she-cat and saw her 
pelt prickling self-consciously. “Do you 
know where they are?” 

“Who? Me?” Grassheart glanced at 
Snowbird as the white she-cat reached 
them. Guilt flashed between them. “They 
were helping with the dens last time I 
saw.” 

Tigerheart pricked his ears. 
Grassheart and Snowbird were hiding 
something. ““What’s going on?” 

Snowbird shot Grassheart a warning 
look. 

Grassheart flicked her tail. “We 


promised we wouldn’t tell,” she mewed 
apologetically. 

“Promised who?” 

“Scorchfur and  Juniperclaw.” 
Grassheart dropped her gaze. 

“What are they doing?” Tigerheart 
thrust his muzzle closer, his pelt rippling 
with foreboding. 

“They're . . . on their way to join 
SkyClan.” 

Join SkyClan? ‘Tigerheart could 
hardly believe his ears. The shock that 
his Clanmates could be so disloyal was 
undercut by guilt, and a thought so 
selfish it made him feel sick. 
ShadowClan’s supposed to be losing 
one warrior today, not three. “When?” 


“Now.” Grassheart didn’t look at 
him. 

“But they hate SkyClan.” Scorchfur 
and Juniperclaw had always made it 
clear that they disliked having SkyClan 
anywhere near ShadowClan’s territory. 

“They said they wanted to be part of 
a real Clan.” Grassheart shifted her 
paws. 

Snowbird stepped forward. “It’s not 
just that they're unhappy here,” she 
mewed. “Scorchfur was really upset that 
he nearly blinded Tawnypelt. He’s 
scared what will happen if he stays in 
ShadowClan.” 

Tigerheart blinked at her. “Scared of 
his own Clanmates?” 


Grassheart shifted her paws. 
“Scared he might lose his temper again, 
or that Tawnypelt and Rowanstar might 
want revenge.” 

“But we’re Clanmates!” Tigerheart 
blinked in disbelief. “We take care of 
one another!” 

“Juniperclaw says that ShadowClan 
cats have forgotten what loyalty means,” 
Snowbird mewed. 

Tigerheart’s hackles lifted. “But 
Juniperclaw left his Clan to join the 
rogues!” How dare he accuse his 
Clanmates of disloyalty when he’d been 
one of the first to betray them? Anger 
pulsed beneath Tigerheart’s pelt. He 
pushed it away. This was no time for 


recriminations. ShadowClan was 
already dwindling. How could he leave 
if they lost two strong warriors like 
Scorchfur and Juniperclaw? 
Puddleshine’s warning would come true; 
ShadowClan would disappear 
completely. “I have to stop them.” He 
bounded toward the SkyClan border. 
Pine needles swished behind him as 
Snowbird and Grassheart gave chase. 
“Go and hunt!” He waved them away 
with a lashing tail. “Ill take care of 
this.” He wanted to sort this out as 
quickly as possible. Nightfall was 
closing in. He had to persuade Scorchfur 
and Juniperclaw to return to 
ShadowClan, and then slip away and 


meet Dovewing before she left without 
him. 

I’m a snake-heart. He ignored the 
voice ringing in his head. Z’m only going 
to persuade them to stay so that I can 
leave. 

No. He was doing the best he could, 
for Dovewing and his Clan. With him 
gone, ShadowClan would need 
Scorchfur and Juniperclaw more than 
ever. 

Heart pounding, he raced between 
the trees. He could smell Scorchfur’s 
scent trail now. Juniperclaw’s was 
beside it. He followed it easily over the 
ditches and to the rise that lifted to the 
SkyClan border. As he neared the 


bottom, he glimpsed their pelts slipping 
around a stretch of brambles. “Stop!” 
His yowl rang through the damp forest. 
He saw them stop and pulled up as their 
faces turned toward him. “Let me talk to 
you!” 

He climbed the slope, fixing them 
with an urgent glare. “Grassheart told 
me you’re planning to join SkyClan.” 

They looked at each other, then 
padded toward him. Their gazes were 
distrustful. 

“Please don’t go.” He stopped in 
front of them, panting. 

Scorchfur narrowed his eyes. “Why 
not?” 

“Youre ShadowClan!” Tigerheart 


stared at him imploringly. “You can’t 
just forget that. It’s where you were born 
and raised. You think like ShadowClan 
cats; you hunt like ShadowClan cats; you 
fight like ShadowClan cats. You don’t 
even know what SkyClan is like! You'll 
never feel you really belong there.” 

Juniperclaw glanced nervously at 
Scorchfur. “Maybe he’s right.” 

Scorchfur frowned. “ShadowClan 
isn’t the Clan it used to be. SkyClan 
might be better. We can teach them some 
useful skills.” 

“Teach them some useful skills’?” 
Tigerheart fought to keep his claws 
sheathed. “If SkyClan learns how we 
fight and hunt, think how easy it would 


be for them to defeat us.” He turned his 
gaze on Juniperclaw desperately. “They 
might take over the whole forest. You 
don’t want that, do you?” 

Juniperclaw’s eyes widened with 
alarm. “I hadn’t thought of that.” He 
looked anxiously at Scorchfur. 

Scorchfur snorted. “I thought you 
said SkyClan cats were our friends.” 

“Friends can have a falling-out.” 
Tigerheart leaned closer. “What if there 
was a border skirmish with 
ShadowClan? Could you fight against us 
for SkyClan?” 

Scorchfur’s pelt prickled uneasily. 
“ShadowClan won’t be fighting any 
battles for a while. We’re hardly a Clan 


anymore.” 

We wont be if you leave. Tigerheart 
scrabbled for another reason for the 
warriors to stay. “If you join SkyClan, 
you'll probably have to retrain. Like 
Twigpaw did. She’d already passed her 
ThunderClan warrior assessment when 
she joined, and she’s still training to be 
a SkyClan warrior.” 

Juniperclaw pricked his ears. “You 
don’t think they’d make me a ’paw, do 
you?” 

Tigerheart shrugged, trying to appear 
calm even as he felt each moment slip 
away like escaping prey. Time was 
passing. He had to get to Dovewing. 
“They might, once they found out that 


rogues gave you your warrior name.” He 
was bluffing, but he could sense 
Juniperclaw wavering. 

“Youre just trying to scare us,” 
Scorchfur grunted. 

“Even if they don’t make you ’paws, 
do you think they’re going to treat you 
with respect?” Tigerheart countered. 

Scorchfur met his gaze challengingly. 
“After I fought with Tawnypelt, why 
would ShadowClan treat me with 
respect?” He sounded angry, but the 
anger was clearly directed at himself. “I 
wish I’d never gone for her eye. It was a 
fox-hearted move. But I was so mad.” 

“T should have intervened earlier,” 
Tigerheart admitted. 


“Rowanstar should have intervened 
earlier,” Juniperclaw remarked 
pointedly. 

“And he would, if it happened 
again,” Tigerheart promised. “It just took 
him by surprise. It took us all by 
surprise.” He tried to think of something 
more to say. He could feel they were 
relenting. Just a few words more. 
Perhaps it was best just to admit the 
truth. “We need you. ShadowClan is in 
trouble, and without you we may not 
survive. You’re both great warriors, and 
I know we can all put our differences 
aside and work together as a Clan again. 
We survived Darktail. We survived the 
Dark Forest. We can survive this. We 


just have to try.” He didn’t hide the 
desperation pulsing in his chest. If he 
was going to leave, he had to make them 
Stay. 

Scorchfur’s ears twitched. “Okay.” 
He glanced toward the border. “Pl 
stay.” 

“Me too.” Juniperclaw sounded 
relieved. 

Joy washed Tigerheart’s pelt like a 
soothing wind. His chest expanded as he 
turned toward camp and began to lead 
the way through the forest. He just had to 
get them halfway there—far enough that 
they wouldn’t change their minds—and 
then he could make an excuse and go to 
Dovewing. “You won’t regret it.” 


“Pm still worried about Rowanstar.” 
Scorchfur fell in beside him. “When he 
first became leader, he seemed so 
strong. But now, whenever we face 
trouble, he doesn’t know what to do.” 

“He reunited the Clan after Darktail, 
didn’t he?” Tigerheart reminded him. 
“That took strength.” 

Scorchfur huffed. “He didn’t reunite 
all the cats. Some of our Clanmates are 
still missing.” 

“Didn’t they die?” Juniperclaw 
murmured darkly. 

“Why did we never find their 
bodies?” Scorchfur argued. 

Juniperclaw shot his denmate an 
anxious look. “Do you think some of 


ShadowClan is still roaming beyond the 
forest?” 

“Of course not.” Tigerheart meowed 
quickly. “Why would any warrior stay 
away from their Clan?” As he spoke, the 
words felt like thorns on his tongue. /’m 
about to leave my Clan. Guilt seemed to 
freeze his heart until it stung. This is 
different, he told himself. He focused on 
the trail ahead. Soon he’d be with 
Dovewing. Then he wouldn’t have to 
think about ShadowClan anymore. No 
more guilt. 

Bracken rustled at the edge of a 
ditch. Prey? Tigerheart pricked his ears. 
Scorchfur turned, his gray fur twitching 
excitedly. Juniperclaw tasted the air. 


“Ts it a rabbit?” As Tigerheart spoke, 
he saw Juniperclaw’s eager gaze 
sharpen into horror. A rank stench rolled 
across the ditch. It wasn’t prey. As 
Tigerheart tried to recognize the smell, 
he glimpsed black-and-white fur through 
the bracken. A roar sounded as a cruel 
snout thrust out. 

Badger! 

The great creature scrambled 
clumsily over the ditch and lunged at 
them, its beady black eyes glittering 
wildly. What was a badger doing here? 
No Clan had reported a set near their 
territory! 

Tigerheart, numb with surprise, 
recoiled as its fetid breath bathed his 


muzzle. The badger turned. Its rump 
knocked Tigerheart into the ditch. As he 
scrabbled breathlessly to his paws, the 
badger snapped at  Juniperclaw. 
Juniperclaw screeched with pain. The 
badger had the black tom’s paw in its 
mouth. Pelt bushing, Tigerheart leaped 
onto the badger’s back, dug his claws in 
hard, and bit down on the back of the 
creature’s thick neck. 

Releasing Juniperclaw, the badger 
spun heavily beneath him. It lifted its 
snout and glanced over its shoulder at 
Tigerheart. Rage sparked in its eyes. 
With a growl, it threw itself onto its side 
and rolled. Tigerheart squawked as the 
badger’s weight fell on top of him. “Get 


its belly!” he puffed at Scorchfur. But the 
gray tom had already flung himself, 
claws slashing, at the badger’s exposed 
underside. With a roar, the badger’s 
limbs closed around Scorchfur. 

It heaved itself upright. Tigerheart 
still clung to its back. Scorchfur wailed, 
trapped beneath it, his muzzle 
dangerously exposed to the badger’s 
snarling jaws. 

Juniperclaw slashed at its nose. The 
badger threw its head up, howling with 
pain as claws sliced its snout. Tigerheart 
thrust his muzzle forward and snapped at 
one of the badger’s ears, sinking his 
teeth into the leathery flesh. The badger 
jerked as though hit by lightning. 


Rearing, it threw Tigerheart from its 
back with a desperate howl of pain. 

Tigerheart hit a tree with a thump 
that sent the forest spinning around him. 
His head cracked against the bark with 
such force that for a moment he thought 
his skull had split. White pain flared 
behind his eyes. Tree roots jabbed his 
ribs as he dropped like dead prey. 
Dazed, he glimpsed a flash of black-and- 
white fur at the edge of his vision. He 
felt the ground shake. 

“Tigerheart!” 

He heard Juniperclaw’s panicked 
cry and felt a tug of loyalty. His 
Clanmates were in danger. Blindly he 
staggered to his paws and shook out his 


fur. Juniperclaw and Scorchfur were 
dodging around the badger, lashing out in 
turns at its hefty flanks. The badger spun 
and snapped at them, its eyes frenzied. 

Struggling from his stupor, 
Tigerheart smelled its fetid stench once 
more and felt heat pulsing from its pelt. 
This badger was sick. He could hear it 
wheezing. Was this why it was foraging 
so far from its home? Had its denmates 
driven it away? 

The badger staggered as Scorchfur 
struggled from beneath it and leaped, 
quick as a squirrel, to Juniperclaw’s 
side. The black tom’s paw was oozing 
blood where the badger had bit it, but he 
was still standing. The warriors faced 


the badger as it eyed them murderously. 
“Its sick!” Tigerheart yowled, 
ignoring the throbbing behind his eyes. 
“We can win if we work together!” He 
scrambled past the flailing badger and 
slid between his Clanmates. They lined 
up beside him and faced the stinking 
creature, ears flat. Tigerheart dug his 
claws into the earth. Juniperclaw bared 
his teeth. Scorchfur lowered his head, 
eyes like slits. Slowly, they crept 
forward, hissing together like snakes. 
Confusion glistened suddenly in the 
badger’s eyes, and it froze. The heat 
from its stinking fur rolled over 
Tigerheart. For a moment he 
remembered the stench of Puddleshine’s 


medicine den when yellowcough had 
gripped the Clan. 

Scorchfur lifted his head and snarled 
menacingly. 

Confusion turned to fear in the 
badger’s fevered gaze. With a grunt, it 
backed away. It knows its beaten. 
Triumph surged in Tigerheart’s chest as 
the badger turned and lumbered heavily 
in the opposite direction. It stumbled 
into the ditch and floundered there for a 
moment. 

“Let’s give it some scars to take 
away,” Scorchfur growled. 

Tigerheart blocked him with a paw. 
“Its already sick,” he meowed. “Let it 
go. We can send out a patrol later to 


check that it’s left our land for good.” 
Actually, you can send out a patrol, he 
thought. 7 won t be here. 

The badger hauled itself from the 
ditch and shambled through the bracken, 
disappearing into the shadowy pines. 

Tigerheart looked at the sky and 
realized with a jolt how late it was. 
Sunset had passed and left the forest in 
darkness. Dovewing! She might be gone 
already! The thumping in his head made 
him wince. He flicked his tail toward 
Juniperclaw. “How’s your paw?” 

Juniperclaw was licking his wound 
gingerly. Pain sparked in his eyes as he 
met Tigerheart’s gaze. “No bones 
broken, but the wound’s deep.” 


“Get him to the medicine den,” 
Tigerheart ordered Scorchfur. “Tell 
Puddleshine the badger was sick. The 
bite might be infected.” 

Scorchfur blinked at him. “Aren’t 
you coming with us?” 

“There’s something I need to do.” 
Tigerheart turned and leaped the ditch, 
heading toward the meeting place. He 
had to do it now. Before Dovewing left. 
Before he lost his nerve. 

Juniperclaw looked puzzled. “I 
thought you hit your head.” 

“It was nothing.” Tigerheart’s head 
was throbbing, but he tried to ignore it. 

“Will you be gone long?” Scorchfur 
called after him. 


Tigerheart didn’t answer. He didn’t 
even look back. He didn’t want to see 
the Clanmates he was leaving. He didn’t 
want to think about them. But he could 
feel their surprised gazes burning his 
pelt. 

I dont care. He had to reach 
Dovewing before she left. Panic drove 
him faster through the forest. He 
scrambled around brambles, fighting the 
dizziness that swayed him one way and 
then the other. He leaped fallen trees 
clumsily. He’d done one last deed for 
ShadowClan before he left. But did it 
cost me the one cat I love best? He 
thought of Dovewing’s green eyes, her 
gentle wisdom, her open heart that loved 


without limit. She’d said she would 
leave at sunset and, as darkness enfolded 
the forest, he knew that it was long past. 
His heart beat in his throat as he raced 
on. I’m coming! You’re the most 
important cat in my life... . I cant lose 
you. 

Please, Dovewing . . . wait for me, 
just a little bit longer. 





CHAPTER 5 
Cog 


When he reached it, the glade stood in 
shadow, empty. He stared, at first in 
disbelief and then with awful certainty. 
A breeze whisked through the trees, and 
shriveled leaves fluttered to the ground. 
She left without me. Grief seared his 
heart. Above him, thick cloud hid the 
moon. Rain began to fall, pattering 
lightly on the canopy. It grew heavier, 
and as Tigerheart stared bereft at the 
deserted clearing, drops began to seep 
through the thick pine branches and 
splash onto his pelt. 

He stood numbly, the ache in his 


head growing sharper. He could feel 
heat behind one ear where his head had 
struck the tree. 

What do I do? Confusion seemed to 
weave his thoughts into knots. His paws 
led him forward. He opened his mouth, 
instinctively tasting the damp air for 
Dovewing’s scent. It hung in the glade, 
so fresh that his heart leaped. He could 
catch up with her. She must have waited 
a while. 

He lowered his head and followed 
her scent trail like a fox. It skirted the 
boundary between SkyClan and 
ShadowClan before cutting straight 
through ShadowClan territory. Shes 
heading for the Thunderpath. He knew 


the Twoleg route that divided the forest 
and the marsh, which lay beyond Clan 
boundaries. 

Does she know where shes going? 
Through the throbbing in his head, he 
tried to remember what she’d told him 
about her dream A huge Twolegplace 
with nests that reach into the sky. I saw 
a roof there with sharp points that stick 
up into the sky like gorse spines. We 
must find that den. Our kits will be safe 
there. 

Did she know where this huge 
Twolegplace was? He’d never heard any 
of the Clan cats speak of it. Perhaps 
Dovewing hoped that the Thunderpath 
would lead her to it. 


Pain pressed above his eyes, dulling 
his thoughts. J just have to follow her 
scent, he thought numbly. He padded on, 
letting his paws and Dovewing’s scent 
guide him while he fought the pounding 
in his head. The rain grew heavier, 
thundering onto the canopy, and when he 
finally reached the forest’s edge, he 
walked out into a downpour that 
drenched his pelt and half-blinded him. 

Monsters growled on the 
Thunderpath ahead, lighting the thick 
rain with their burning eyes. Their paws 
threw up spray. Tigerheart hung back. 
The Thunderpath was jammed with a 
stream of monsters thicker than he’d 
ever seen. Were the Twolegs migrating? 


Their monsters streamed after one 
another like geese heading south for the 
winter, leaving no gap to cross. 
Tigerheart stopped a few tail-lengths 
from the edge, out of reach of the filthy 
spray. His head spun as he stared at the 
stampeding monsters. Had Dovewing 
found a way between their rolling paws? 
He tried to glimpse a gap, but the 
speeding monsters made him dizzy, 
whipping past him one after another. 
Rain pounded his pelt, streaming into his 
eyes. Blinking rapidly, his head aching, 
he sank to his belly and watched the 
passing monsters helplessly. Dovewing. 
Why didn't you wait? His heart seemed 
to crack open with loss and frustration. 


They should be facing this together. Why 
hadn’t he met her in time? The might 
darkened around him; the burning lights 
from the monsters blurred. Their 
growling faded as his thoughts jumbled 
and he collapsed into unconsciousness. 
He dreamed. Puddleshine stood 
beside him as the sun rose over the 
ShadowClan camp. Tigerheart knew at 
once that he was in the medicine cat’s 
vision. The sun burned beyond the trees, 
casting black shadows in stripes across 
the clearing. Juniperclaw, Tawnypelt, 
Snowbird, and Whorlpaw padded from 
their dens. Grassheart yawned in the 
middle of the clearing and stretched as a 
dark shadow fell across her glossy pelt. 


Rowanstar moved beside the rock near 
his den, his eyes flashing in the dawn 
light. Tigerheart blinked in the fierce 
sunshine as it sliced between the trees, 
half-blinded until suddenly the sun began 
to fade. 

“Puddleshine.” Tigerheart called to 
the medicine cat watching from the edge 
of the clearing, but the brown tom didn’t 
seem to hear him. His gaze was fixed on 
the clearing as the sun dissolved into the 
pale blue sky and the shadows 
evaporated like mist. 

I’m seeing what he saw. Tigerheart 
knew where this dream had carried him 
and watched intently. He glanced toward 
his father. Would the ShadowClan leader 


fade with the shadows? Rowanstar 
blinked beside the rock, his gaze blank 
as though unaware of the changing light. 
Then, suddenly, the sun brightened once 
more. Tigerheart jerked his nose toward 
it. Puddleshine didn’t mention this part 
of his vision. He narrowed his eyes as 
the sun reddened and intensified until it 
looked like flame burning at the edge of 
the forest. The shadows in camp 
darkened once more, reaching across the 
clearing, casting his Clanmates into 
gloom. Then Tigerheart saw himself 
standing at the edge of the clearing, his 
outline carved from darkness by brilliant 
sunshine. His pelt shimmered in the 
fierce light. The shadow he cast was 


long and black, far darker than any other 
in camp, while across the clearing 
Rowanstar dissolved into milky light. 

“When the sun is strong, the shadows 
are strong.” 

As Puddleshine’s mew rang across 
the clearing, Tigerheart felt cold. A chill 
gripped him and he struggled awake. 
Rain was seeping through his fur. He 
blinked open his eyes, Puddleshine’s 
words ringing in his ears. When the sun 
is strong... 

He sat up. The rain was still falling. 
Weak dawn light filtered through the 
gray clouds. The Thunderpath lay empty, 
the marsh stretching into a haze of rain 
beyond. He felt groggy, his head still 


aching. He shivered with cold and 
fluffed out his pelt. When the sun is 
strong. Puddleshine’s words buzzed in 
his ears like a bothersome fly. Unease 
tugged in Tigerheart’s belly. The dream 
meant something. He could sense it. The 
sun. Tigerheart stiffened. The son / 
When the son is strong, the shadows are 
strong! Understanding burst like starlight 
in his thoughts. Rowanstar wasn’t the 
sun that would make ShadowClan 
strong. Only the son could save 
ShadowClan from disappearing. The son 
is the sun! 

His headache faded. Energy fizzed 
beneath his pelt. He had to get back to 
his Clan. He was the one who could 


save them! He headed away from the 
Thunderpath and hurried into the forest. 
Why hadn’t he realized earlier? 

As he crossed the wet forest floor, 
the sound of rain pounding the branches 
above him, guilt jabbed at his belly. 

Dovewing. The thought pricked his 
heart. J’m sorry. His Clan needed him 
too much. And if Dovewing had truly 
needed him, she would have waited. ... 

She had to understand—his whole 
Clan was at stake. 

He reached the ditches and crossed 
them, his belly feeling more hollow with 
every leap. Grief tugged at his heart. / 
have to save them. As he saw the 
bramble wall of the camp looming ahead 


of him, Tigerheart lifted his chin. 
Dovewing would have to take care of 
herself for now, and their kits. He 
ignored the shame that clawed in his 
belly. If ShadowClan was to survive, he 
needed to be here. 





CHAPTER 6 
Cog 


In the days since Dovewing had left, the 
rain hadn’t let up. Tigerheart trudged 
through it now, following Stonewing, 
Juniperclaw, and Whorlpaw home from 
a hunt. The swelling behind his ear had 
eased since Puddleshine had treated it 
with nettles soaked in rainwater. His 
headache had lingered for a day but was 
gone now. 

Tigerheart held a soggy sparrow 
between his jaws. The others carried 
prey too. Whorlpaw was clearly proud 
of the young rabbit he’d caught and 
walked with his tail high, despite the 


rain dripping from the trees and the earth 
squelching beneath his paws. 

It had been a good hunt. The patrol 
had worked well together. Tigerheart felt 
hope flicker in his chest each time 
Juniperclaw called out to Stonewing to 
warn him of prey heading his way. And 
whenever Whorlpaw dipped his head 
respectfully as Juniperclaw gently 
adjusted his hunting crouch or showed 
him which part of a bracken stalk held 
prey-scent even when it rained, 
Tigerheart had dared to believe that 
ShadowClan would grow stronger and 
more united with time. Perhaps it didn’t 
matter if Rowanstar wasn’t a strong 
leader. Perhaps it was enough that 


Tigerheart was there to support them. 
Meanwhile, hunting and patrolling 
would bring the Clan together. Training 
their young to be great warriors would 
remind them of what it was to be loyal 
and brave. In a few seasons, the rogues 
would be forgotten and ShadowClan 
would thrive once more. 

But where would Dovewing and his 
kits be by then? The thought pricked 
Tigerheart’s chest. Would she come back 
once she felt their kits would be safe 
with the Clans? If not, perhaps he could 
find a way to join her as soon as he felt 
that ShadowClan’s future was secure. 

He dared not think about the dangers 
waiting beyond the Clan borders. Shes a 


warrior. The thought comforted him. 
She’d survived the battle with the Dark 
Forest. And the rogues. But what if she 
wasn t all right? He pushed the thought 
away, fear slicing his belly so sharply he 
winced. Was his Clan really worth 
endangering his mate and kits for? 
Frustration itched beneath his pelt. Why 
did he have to make such a choice? It 
wasn’t fair. 

Juniperclaw halted as he reached the 
camp entrance. Stonewing and 
Whorlpaw stopped beside him. He 
dropped his prey and sniffed the air 
suspiciously. “ThunderClan cats have 
been here.” He looked at Tigerheart. “I 
wonder what they wanted.” 


A fresh chill crept through 
Tigerheart’s damp pelt. He could guess 
what they had wanted. Especially when 
he tasted the air and smelled Ivypool’s 
scent. They’d be looking for Dovewing. 
Of course her sister would come here. 
His fur prickled nervously. Had she said 
anything to Rowanstar about the secret 
meetings? 

“Tigerheart!” Tawnypelt called 
through the entrance. “You’re back.” She 
hurried out of camp and quickly nosed 
Tigerheart away from the patrol. 

Stonewing called to her. “What did 
ThunderClan want?” 

“One of their warriors is missing.” 
Tawnypelt glanced at the white tom and 


flicked her tail nonchalantly. “It’s their 
problem, not ours, but they wondered if 
we'd seen her.” 

Juniperclaw narrowed his eyes. “I 
hope Rowanstar didn’t let us get drawn 
into ThunderClan’s problems.” 

“Of course he didn’t,” Tawnypelt 
answered sharply. 

“We’ve got enough of our own,” 
Juniperclaw  grouched. “First it’s 
prophecies about coming storms, then 
it’s six-toed cats, then missing warriors. 
ThunderClan is always coming to us 
with some problem. I hope Rowanstar 
was firm with them.” 

Irritation flared beneath Tigerheart’s 
pelt. “Of course he was firm,” he mewed 


curtly. “Why wouldn’t he be?” 

Stonewing dropped his thrush. “He’s 
not exactly decisive these days.” 

“How dare you?”  Tigerheart 
glowered at the tom. His gaze flashed to 
Juniperclaw. “You weren’t here when 
ThunderClan came. You don’t know 
what was said. Don’t assume Rowanstar 
let any cat push him around. You have to 
trust him!” His hackles lifted. “He’s our 
leader.” He glared at Juniperclaw and 
Stonewing until they dropped their 
gazes. 

Whorlpaw shifted his paws uneasily. 
“Which warrior 1s missing?” 

“Dovewing.” Tawnypelt’s mew was 
even. 


Whorlpaw’s eyes widened. “Perhaps 
the sick badger got her.” 

“Nonsense.” Tawnypelt flicked her 
tail impatiently. “We sent out a patrol to 
check that the badger was gone, 
remember? There’s been no scent of it 
on our land since the rain started.” 

“Perhaps it went onto ThunderClan’s 
territory,’ Whorlpaw persisted. 

“If she was attacked by a badger on 
their territory, they’d know about it,” 
Juniperclaw pointed out. 

Tigerheart shifted his weight self- 
consciously. He was the only cat who 
knew the truth. He dropped his gaze. 
Ivypool must be beside herself with 
worry. ThunderClan would be grieving. 


Tawnypelt nudged Tigerheart to one 
side, flicking her tail toward the patrol. 
“Take your catch into camp,” she told 
them. “The fresh-kill pile needs filling.” 
As they obeyed and disappeared through 
the bramble tunnel, Tawnypelt looked 
into Tigerheart’s eyes. “Do you know 
anything about Dovewing’s 
disappearance?” 

“No.” Tigerheart’s pelt burned as he 
struggled to return his mother’s gaze 
innocently. “Why should I?” 

“I saw the way you were with her 
when we were living with ThunderClan. 
You ate with her and talked with her like 
she was the only cat in camp. And it 
wasn’t just me who noticed. Ivypool 


asked specifically if you knew anything 
about Dovewing’s disappearance. She’s 
clearly suspicious. She’s on her way to 
SkyClan right now to ask them if they’ ve 
seen Dovewing. But I know she doesn’t 
believe they'll have any answers.” Her 
whiskers twitched. “Was there anything 
going on between you and Dovewing?” 

Tigerheart hesitated, then avoided 
the question. “I don’t know where 
Dovewing is.” 

Tawnypelt’s eyes narrowed. 
Tigerheart could sense doubt glittering 
behind them. But she didn’t ask again. 
“ShadowClan needs you, Tigerheart. 
Your father needs you.” 

Anger surged beneath Tigerheart’s 


pelt. “You think I don’t know that?” Jf 1 
didnt, I’d be with Dovewing right now! 
I’d have followed her wherever she 
went. 

Tawnypelt held his gaze for a 
moment, then turned away. “A warrior is 
loyal to his Clan above all things.” 

As she headed back to camp, 
Tigerheart called after her. “You don’t 
need to tell me about the warrior code!” 
She had no idea what he was giving up 
to stay loyal to his Clan. Not just 
Dovewing, but his kits. He might never 
know them. 

As she disappeared through the 
bramble tunnel, urgency tugged at his 
paws. He headed for the ThunderClan 


border, rain splashing his pelt. He had to 
speak with Ivypool before she sparked 
suspicion in any other cats. He didn’t 
want all the Clans silently believing that 
he was responsible for Dovewing’s 
disappearance. It had been Dovewing’s 
decision. Ivypool had to know that. 
Should I tell her where Dovewing was 
heading? His belly twisted. I cant 
betray her! What if ThunderClan 
follows her and brings her home? He 
slowed. Would that be so bad? Shes 
not safe alone. His thoughts were 
spinning as he crossed the border. 
Tawnypelt had said Ivypool had gone to 
SkyClan. He could intercept her on her 
way home, before she reached her camp. 


Climbing a leaf-strewn rise, he ducked 
through bracken and shadowed a 
ThunderClan trail. He tasted Ivypool’s 
scent before he heard her call. 

“Tigerheart.” There was anger in her 
yowl. He stopped as she marched 
toward him. She was alone, her pelt 
bristling as she glared at him. “You’re 
on our land. And I know why. You’ve 
come to lie to me again. You’re here to 
persuade me that you have nothing to do 
with Dovewing’s disappearance. But 
you know where she 1s, don’t you?” 

“No.” 

“You knew she was going to leave!” 
Ivypool accused. 

“I did,” Tigerheart admitted. “I tried 


to stop her, but she was determined.” 

“Where has she gone?” 

A huge Twolegplace with nests that 
reach into the sky... 

He could still hear Dovewing’s 
words clearly. He pictured the 
desperation in her green eyes as she told 
him. He couldn’t betray her. She was 
convinced that their kits’ lives depended 
on finding a gorse-spined den. He 
looked at Ivypool. “I tracked her as far 
as the Thunderpath beside the marsh.” 

“But no farther?” Ivypool’s eyes 
flashed with disgust. “Did the monsters 
scare you away?” 

“My Clan needs me,” Tigerheart 
meowed simply. “I couldn’t abandon 


them.” 

“But you could abandon 
Dovewing?” Ivypool flexed her claws. 

She abandoned me ! Frustration 
flared in Tigerheart’s belly. “I thought 
you didn’t want us to be together,” he 
snapped. 

Ivypool spat at him. “Do you think 
I'd prefer she was out there alone?” 

Guilt swamped Tigerheart. Ivypool 
was right. He had chosen to stay with his 
Clan. He’d left Dovewing to face the 
land beyond the forest alone. 

Ivypool thrust her face closer. “I 
always knew you were trouble. You 
never cared about Dovewing. If you had, 
you'd never have let her leave.” With a 


snarl, she lashed her claws across his 
muzzle. 

Tigerheart didn’t flinch. He deserved 
it. He felt the sting of torn flesh and the 
wetness of blood welling on his nose. 
Without moving, he held Ivypool’s gaze. 
“T love her,” he confessed. “I should 
have stopped her, but I couldn’t.” He’d 
let Scorchfur and Juniperclaw keep him 
from meeting her. If he had let his 
Clanmates go to SkyClan, he could have 
met Dovewing before she left. He might 
even have been able to persuade her to 
stay. Instead he’d given up everything he 
loved for his Clan. His eyes grew hot 
with grief. 

Ivypool stared at him with hatred. 


“You're a coward. And a fox-heart. 
Dovewing deserved a better mate than 
you.” Tail lashing, she turned away and 
left him alone beneath the dripping 
pines. 

Shes right. His throat thickened 
with grief, almost choking him. 
Dovewing, I’m so sorry. 





CHAPTER 7 
Cog 


“The rain has driven the prey too far 
underground.” Grassheart lifted a clump 
of soggy leaves and peered underneath. 
“There’s a mouse hole here.” She 
reached in but dragged up nothing but 
mud. 

Tigerheart’s belly rumbled. The rain 
still hadn’t ceased. The scratches 
Ivypool had given him still stung. They 
hurt worse in his sleep, when he 
dreamed of Dovewing wandering alone. 
Each morning he woke to a fresh ache in 
his heart. The fresh-kill pile had 
dwindled to nothing as the forest 


creatures hid from the endless torrent. 
As he stood with the patrol now, he 
grunted at Grassheart. “Prey must search 
for food eventually. It'll starve quicker 
than us.” He tasted the air but smelled 
nothing but wet wood. 

Juniperclaw paced behind him. 
Strikestone and Snakepaw huddled 
beneath the shelter of a bramble, their 
pelts slicked against their skinny frames. 

“There might be frogs in the 
ditches,” Juniperclaw suggested. “We 
could catch those.” 

“There’s probably fish there by 
now,” Grassheart snorted. “They’ve 
been flooded for days.” 

“Tawnypelt led a hunting patrol to 


the ditches this morning while you were 
marking the borders,” Tigerheart told 
Juniperclaw. “They came back with a 
drowned vole and four slugs.” 

Snakepaw shuddered, her nose 
wrinkling. “Perhaps we could look 
around the beech patch near the SkyClan 
border,” she suggested. “The beechnuts 
might attract something tastier than 
slugs.” 

Tigerheart glanced at the honey- 
brown tabby. It was a good idea. He 
flicked his tail. “Nice plan, Snakepaw.” 

She glanced shyly at her paws. 
Grassheart shook the rain from her pelt 
and headed toward the patch of forest 
where, moons ago, beeches had found a 


gap among the pines and had grown 
vigorously, as though celebrating their 
small victory over the evergreens. 

Their leaves were browning in the 
leaf-fall chill. Some hung limply on bare 
branches. Most lay on the ground in 
sodden swathes around the roots. The 
small opening to the sky let more rain in 
and Tigerheart narrowed his eyes against 
it as he reached the beech patch. Beyond 
it, the ground sloped upward toward the 
SkyClan border nearby. Spiky beechnuts 
scattered the ground, their skin peeled 
open, the nuts gone. 

Grassheart kicked miserably at an 
empty shell. “It looks like the prey has 
already been and gone.” 


“They didn’t get everything.” 
Snakepaw tapped an unopened beechnut 
with her paw, her eyes bright. 

Tigerheart flicked his tail toward his 
Clanmates. “Let’s surround the beech 
patch and wait. It might take a while, but 
something is bound to come looking for 
food eventually.” He threaded through 
the battered bracken stalks sprouting 
beside a beech and crouched just outside 
the cluster of trees. The rest of the patrol 
did the same, encircling the beeches. As 
Tigerheart flattened himself against the 
ground, hoping his pelt would blend 
against the moldering leaves, his 
Clanmates hunkered down until he could 
hardly see them. 


Now we wait. He braced himself 
against the cold that began to seep 
through his pelt. As his belly rumbled 
with hunger, he thought of Dovewing. He 
had tried to keep himself busy since 
she’d left, but there were always 
moments of stillness when his thoughts 
would slide toward her. Where was she? 
Was it raining there too? Was she wet 
and hungry? Their unborn kits would 
need food, and so would she. Would he 
ever see her again? Would he ever meet 
his kits? Grief swelled in his chest. He 
tried to push it away. But the scent of her 
still lingered in his fur despite the rain. 
Perhaps he was imagining it. He no 
longer knew. 


Paw steps thudded the ground 
nearby. He stiffened, his eyes widening. 
Prey? His heart leaped as a rabbit raced 
across SkyClan’s border toward the 
beech patch. He saw Juniperclaw’s eyes 
widen with excitement beyond the 
bracken. Not yet. He flicked his tail to 
order the warrior to wait. He wanted to 
make sure the rabbit was surrounded. It 
wasn’t going to escape. 

Suddenly a SkyClan warrior crashed 
across the border and streaked after the 
rabbit. Plumwillow! The she-cat’s gaze 
was fixed on her quarry. Her fur was 
fluffed with excitement. She’d clearly 
been chasing it for a while. As the rabbit 
reached the edge of the beech patch, 


Plumwillow leaped. Fast as a bird, she 
swooped onto the terrified prey and, 
clamping her jaws around its neck, 
snapped its spine with a killing bite. 

Her eyes shone as she straightened 
and rested her paw on the rabbit’s fat 
flank. 

“What are you doing?” 
Juniperclaw’s angry yowl made her 
stiffen. She turned, eyes wide, toward 
the ShadowClan warrior as he strode 
from his hiding place among the bracken. 

Grassheart marched between the 
beeches, fur bristling with indignation. 
“That’s our rabbit!” 

Plumwillow blinked at them in 
surprise. “But I caught it.” 


“On our territory!” Juniperclaw 
glared at her. 

“I started chasing it on SkyClan 
land,” Plumwillow argued. “That makes 
it SkyClan prey.” 

As Snakepaw followed Strikestone 
to join their Clanmates, Tigerheart 
padded from the bracken. Rain pounded 
the forest floor around the cats as they 
eyed one another angrily. “Perhaps 
SkyClan doesn’t understand our ways 
yet,” he meowed sympathetically. He 
dipped his head to Plumwillow. “Prey 
belongs to the Clan where it’s caught.” 

Plumwillow tipped her head. 
“Really?” She sounded unconvinced. 
“What about the rabbit Sandynose and 


Rabbitleap caught for you? That was 
caught on SkyClan land, wasn’t it? And 
yet you took it because it ran from 
ShadowClan territory.” She blinked rain 
from her eyes. 

Juniperclaw snorted. “If Sandynose 
and Rabbitleap want to give away prey, 
that’s up to them. We have a hungry Clan 
to feed.” 

“So do I.” Plumwillow pulled the 
rabbit closer. “Is ShadowClan’s hunger 
more important than SkyClan’s hunger?” 

“No Clans hunger is more 
important.” Tigerheart saw Strikestone 
flexing his claws. Juniperclaw’s hackles 
were twitching. His Clanmates were 
ready to fight for this prey. “Thats why 


we have the warrior code. To help settle 
disputes like this.” 

Plumwillow eyed the ShadowClan 
cats warily, then lifted her chin. “If you 
want my prey, you'll have to take it from 
me. I chased it and I caught it. It belongs 
to SkyClan.” 

Juniperclaw’s whiskers twitched 
menacingly. “Is this how SkyClan shows 
respect for us? When we gave you some 
of our territory, we were doing you a 
favor. Now you steal our prey.” 

“Pm not stealing.” Plumwillow’s 
eyes flared with anger. “And when we 
moved into our new home, we did you a 
favor. You admitted that you weren't 
strong enough to patrol a large territory. 


With us patrolling, you know your 
border is safe from rogues.” She 
emphasized the last word with 
satisfaction. 

Grassheart stared in disbelief. “Does 
SkyClan think it’s protecting us?” 

Plumwillow flicked her tail. “There 
are barely enough of you to make a Clan. 
Of course we’re protecting you. So is 
ThunderClan. We are keeping your 
borders safe while you recover.” 

Tigerheart quickly padded between 
his Clanmates and Plumwillow. The 
SkyClan warrior wasn’t making this 
easy. But she did have a point: Having 
friendly allies on their borders was 
useful. Would ShadowClan be wise to 


antagonize SkyClan by stealing 
Plumwillow’s catch? Was she really 
prepared to fight for it? The 
ShadowClan cats might be weak, but 
four warriors and an apprentice could 
easily hurt a lone warrior. He checked 
the slope to see if Plumwillow was part 
of a patrol, but it was deserted. Shes 
brave. He admired her courage. It 
reminded him, with a_ twinge, of 
Dovewing. 

“Tigerheart?” Juniperclaw was 
glaring at him. “Let’s take this rabbit and 


99 


go. 

“No.” Tigerheart faced his Clanmate. 
Plumwillow was right. She had chased 
this prey down and killed it. 


“ShadowClan owes SkyClan for the 
rabbit Sandynose and Rabbitleap caught 
for us.” 

“What about the warrior code?” 
Grassheart looked outraged. 

“Prey belongs to the Clan where it’s 
caught,” Snakepaw reminded him. 

“I know what it says.” Tigerheart 
shifted his paws. First his mother, now 
an apprentice. Did everyone think they 
knew the warrior code better than he 
did? Irritation pricked beneath his pelt. 
He could be with Dovewing now, not 
settling stupid squabbles over prey. He 
lashed his tail. “The rabbit came from 
SkyClan land, and Plumwillow was 
barely over the border when she caught 


it.” 

Juniperclaw stared at Tigerheart, 
wide-eyed. “Are you serious?” He 
lowered his voice to a whisper. “You 
know how much we need this prey.” 

“But we are warriors,” Tigerheart 
hissed back. He raised his muzzle. “The 
warrior code says that warriors are 
honorable and fair. Taking 
Plumwillow’s prey now wouldn’t be 
fair. But in the future, let’s all remember 
that prey belongs to the Clan who owns 
the land on which it’s caught.” He eyed 
Plumwillow sternly. “Right?” She 
nodded curtly. 

Snakepaw glanced at Strikestone, 
doubt shimmering in her eyes. 


Strikestone shrugged at her. “He’s 
the deputy.” 

“That’s right,” Tigerheart growled. 
“You will do as I say. Which is to let 
Plumwillow take her prey and go back 
to her territory.” He urged Plumwillow 
to hurry with a warning look. 

The SkyClan cat picked up the 
rabbit, nodded quickly at him, and 
headed for the border. 

Juniperclaw lashed his tail as she 
disappeared over the rise. “Are you 
crazy?” 

Tigerheart ignored him. “Let’s get 
back to hunting.” He returned to his 
position among the bracken and 
crouched down to watch the beech patch 


once more. 

Juniperclaw exchanged an angry 
look with Grassheart while Strikestone 
nudged Snakepaw toward the 
undergrowth. Gradually they returned to 
their positions and dropped into hunting 
crouches. 

Tigerheart’s pelt prickled uneasily. 
Had he made the right decision? Of 
course I did. Rules were rules, but 
warriors needed to have common sense 
too. Surely, at the moment, a good 
relationship with SkyClan was more 
important than a single rabbit? But 
ShadowClan is hungry. He felt 
rainwater reaching through his pelt. He 
couldn’t push away a thought nagging at 


the back of his mind. He shivered as he 
pictured Dovewing far away, her green 
eyes hollow with hunger as a bigger, 
stronger cat stole the prey she’d just 
caught. Had his worry about Dovewing 
made him kinder to Plumwillow than he 
should have been? 


“Is that it?” Rowanstar stared at the 
vole and the bedraggled squirrel 
Tigerheart’s patrol dropped onto the 
meager fresh-kill pile. 

“We were lucky to find that,” 
Tigerheart told him. “We’d have nothing 
if Snakepaw hadn’t thought of stalking 
the beech patch” He glanced 
appreciatively at the honey-brown 
apprentice. Her gaze warmed with 


pride. 

“Nothing?” Juniperclaw pushed past 
him and glared at Rowanstar. “Why 
don’t you tell our leader about the rabbit 
you gave away?” 

Rowanstar’s gaze flashed toward 
Tigerheart. “What happened?” 

Tigerheart saw anger in his father’s 
gaze. “It was the right thing to do,” he 
meowed. “Plumwillow had chased it 
and caught it.” 

“On our territory,” Grassheart put in. 

“She had only just crossed the 
border,’ Tigerheart reminded her, 
irritably. He’d abandoned Dovewing for 
his Clanmates, and now they betrayed 
him. He shot her a reproachful look. 


Rowanstar growled. “If it had 
crossed the border, it was our prey. 
That’s what the warrior code says.” 

“But what about the rabbit 
Sandynose gave us a quarter moon ago?” 
Tigerheart argued. Wasn’t anyone going 
to support him? “If you believed so 
strongly in upholding that rule, you’d 
have insisted on returning it.” 

“If SkyClan wants to behave like 
soft-bellies, then let them. We don’t have 
to starve just so we can be like them. 
We’re ShadowClan.” Rowanstar lifted 
his muzzle. “And that means something.” 

Tigerheart’s pelt crawled with 
resentment. Now Rowanstar was 
behaving like a leader—over a piece of 


prey! 

“I did the right thing,” Tigerheart felt 
certain now. His worry over Dovewing 
hadn’t influenced him. His instinct had 
been true: Warriors should be fair, and 
keeping peace with their neighbors was 
more important than one catch. “It was 
clearly Plumwillow’s rabbit. And if 
there’s one rabbit in the forest, there 
must be more. Let’s catch our own prey, 
not steal from other Clans.” 

Rowanstar narrowed his eyes. “It 
was our rabbit,” he growled softly. “We 
have to make SkyClan pay for stealing 
it.” 

“I gave it to them!” Frustration 
rippled beneath Tigerheart’s pelt. 


p? 


But his father wasn’t listening. The 
ShadowClan leader nodded to 
Juniperclaw. “Come with me.” Glancing 
around the clearing, he called to the cats 
watching around the camp. “Snowbird, 
Whorlpaw,  Scorchfur, Flowerpaw, 
Grassheart, Stonewing! Follow me.” 

He marched out of camp. His 
Clanmates followed, exchanging 
approving glances, their pelts rippling 
with excitement. Tigerheart dug his 
claws into the ground. He’d stayed to 
save his Clan, and they weren’t even 
listening to him. Was Rowanstar really 
going to start a war over a rabbit? 

He felt fur brush his flank. 
Tawnypelt’s mew sounded in his ear. “It 


looks like old times,” she murmured 
wistfully as the warriors disappeared 
from camp. 

Tigerheart didn’t look at her. “He’s 
wrong.” 

“He’s fighting for his Clan.” There 
was relief in her mew. She was clearly 
pleased to see Rowanstar being so 
strong. “Why don’t you go with him? He 
wants to teach you how to lead. It’ll be 
your turn one day.” 

Dread dropped like a stone in 
Tigerheart’s belly. My turn. He was 
going to be tied to ShadowClan forever. 
What about Dovewing? 

Tawnypelt nudged him forward. “Go 


99 


on. 


Reluctantly, Tigerheart followed his 
father and Clanmates out of camp. 
Perhaps it wasn’t too late to stop the war 
Rowanstar seemed so intent on starting. 
As he hurried through the woods, 
tracking the path of scuffed pine needles, 
he couldn’t help thinking Plumwillow 
had been right. We are keeping your 
borders safe while you recover. 
ShadowClan was weak. It needed allies 
on its borders while it recovered, not 
enemies. 

He remembered his dream and saw 
the strong sunshine glinting on his pelt as 
the shadows deepened around him. He 
saw the long, dark shadow he cast. / 
must be the sun from Puddleshines 


vision. Rowanstar is only leading them 
into trouble. 

He caught up with the ShadowClan 
patrol as they neared the SkyClan camp. 
Surely SkyClan would hear them 
coming? They weren’t trying to hide 
their paw steps, and he could hear their 
voices before he saw them. 

“We'll show them!” Juniperclaw 
muttered angrily. 

“No one steals our prey,” growled 
Snowbird. 

“Tigerheart.” Rowanstar turned to 
look at him as he slid past Stonewing 
and Scorchfur. “You’ve come to see how 
a Clan fights for its honor.” Pride burned 
so fiercely in his father’s eyes that 


Tigerheart felt a twinge of pity. You are 
wrong. But Juniperclaw and Snowbird 
were plucking excitedly at the ground 
while Grassheart and Scorchfur’s pelts 
rippled. They were clearly relishing the 
prospect of a battle. 

The wide stretch of bracken that hid 
the entrance to SkyClan’s camp 
shivered. Leafstar pushed her way 
through. Plumwillow, Sandynose, and 
Sparrowpelt followed at her heels. The 
warriors stopped and stared quizzically 
at the ShadowClan patrol. 

“Is something wrong?” Leafstar 
asked. 

“You stole a rabbit of ours.” 
Rowanstar cut straight to the point. 


Juniperclaw snorted, and Stonewing 
raised his hackles aggressively. 

Leafstar looked puzzled. 

“I chased a rabbit over the scent line 
and killed it on ShadowClan land,” 
Plumwillow explained. 

Leafstar’s gaze remained fixed on 
Rowanstar as Plumwillow went on. 

“But Tigerheart said I could keep it, 
so I brought it back to camp.” 

“Tigerheart was wrong.” Rowanstar 
glared at Leafstar. “SkyClan should 
know better than to take prey killed on 
another Clan’s land. Or perhaps you 
forgot the warrior code while you were 
in the gorge.” 

Leafstar’s fur twitched irritably 


along her spine, but her eyes remained 
calm. “We know the warrior code. And 
so, I assume, does Tigerheart. He let 
Plumwillow take the rabbit. I guess he 
had his reasons.” 

Tigerheart shifted uneasily. He still 
believed he’d made the right decision. 
SkyClan was worth keeping as an ally. 
But his Clanmates clearly disagreed. 
Scorchfur shot him a look of reproach. 
Tigerheart ignored it. This was 
Rowanstar’s moment. Perhaps this 
challenge to SkyClan would regain him 
the respect and loyalty of his Clan. 

It might also make enemies when 
ShadowClan needed enemies least. 

“Tigerheart was wrong,” Rowanstar 


growled again. 

Leafstar whisked her tail lightly. 
“Even if he was, we can’t give back 
what we’ ve already eaten.” 

“Already?”  Juniperclaw glared 


distrustfully at Leafstar. 

“Do you think I’m lying?” Leafstar 
returned the warrior’s gaze 
unwaveringly. 


“I think SkyClan should be taught 
some respect,” the black tom hissed. He 
glanced at Rowanstar, as though asking 
permission to attack. 

Rowanstar glanced around his 
warriors, then flicked his tail. “Battle 
stances!” he ordered. 

No! Tigerheart’s pelt bushed with 


alarm. As  Juniperclaw, Scorchfur, 
Grassheart, and the others crouched, 
ready to leap, he shot between the two 
groups of warriors. “We can’t fight over 
a rabbit!” he yowled. He glared at his 
Clanmates, facing them with bared teeth. 

They blinked at him, shock freezing 
them where they stood. 

“We need SkyClan’s friendship more 
than we needed that rabbit!” Tigerheart 
stared imploringly at his father, willing 
him to understand that good neighbors 
meant strong borders. 

Rowanstar’s fur pricked. His brow 
furrowed as he returned Tigerheart’s 
gaze. Before he could speak, Leafstar cut 
in. 


“Tf its a rabbit you want, we will 
give ShadowClan the next rabbit we 
catch.” 

Relief washed Tigerheart’s pelt. At 
least one leader was ready to be 
sensible. He looked hopefully at 
Rowanstar. “That sounds fair,” he 
meowed. 

Rowanstar was still staring at him. 
Tigerheart saw anger in his father’s 
eyes. His Clanmates began to shift 
nervously, as though uncertain what to 
do. They glanced at Rowanstar, but the 
ShadowClan leader’s attention was 
fixed on Tigerheart. 

“I guess having their next rabbit 
sounds reasonable,” Snowbird mewed 


grudgingly. 

“I suppose it shows respect,” 
Stonewing conceded. 

Tigerheart saw his Clanmates’ fur 
flatten as they eased out of their battle 
stances. He tore his gaze from 
Rowanstar and nodded at Leafstar. “That 
sounds like a fair settlement.” He hoped 
she could read the gratitude in his gaze. 

“We’ll leave one at the border as 
soon as we catch it.” She paused, her 
gaze flicking meaningfully around the 
ShadowClan cats. “As a gesture of 
goodwill.” With a flick of her tail, 
Leafstar turned toward SkyClan’s camp 
and led her warriors through the 
bracken. 


As they disappeared, Tigerheart 
looked nervously at his Clanmates. 

“I suppose we do get a rabbit.” 
Strikestone began to head toward the 
border. “And no blood shed.” 

“I still wish we could have left them 
with a scratch or two,” Juniperclaw 
grunted as he followed. Snowbird and 
Grassheart glanced accusingly at 
Rowanstar, and then headed away. 
Flowerpaw and Snakepaw hurried after 
them. 

Tigerheart gazed at his father, his 
heart pounding in his ears. Rowanstar 
still hadnt moved. “I solved the 
problem,” he offered, hoping his father 
would see that Leafstar had conceded 


defeat in offering to replace the rabbit, 
even though it hadn’t been taken without 
permission. That was surely a victory? 

“How dare you undermine me?” 
Rowanstar’s mew was ice-cold. 

Tigerheart’s paws felt suddenly 
heavy. Of course Rowanstar would 
misunderstand his intentions. He’d been 
trying to keep the peace because 
ShadowClan’s security was more 
important than its leader’s pride. “It 
would have been wrong to make 
enemies of SkyClan now.” Was he 
wasting his breath? “We’re not strong 
enough to protect our own borders. We 
need them to remain allies.” 

Rowanstar shot him a look of 


disgust, then barged past him. 

Tigerheart followed, feeling sick. 
He’d done what was right for his Clan, 
but he knew he’d crossed a line his 
father would not easily forgive. It hurt to 
disappoint him. Worse, it worried him to 
know that Rowanstar could be so 
shortsighted. How could Tigerheart ever 
hope to protect ShadowClan if his father 
wasn’t smart enough to see beyond a 
piece of prey? Hopelessness flooded 
him. He could keep the love of his father 
or he could save his Clan. What choice 
was that? Was this what he’d abandoned 
Dovewing and his kits for? 





CHAPTER 8 
Cog 


Tigerheart hunted alone until nightfall. 
The three mice and two shrews he added 
to the fresh-kill pile meant that all his 
Clanmates could eat. They’d find the 
flesh sweet and soft, but they wouldn’t 
taste the bitter resentment that had driven 
him to hunt so determinedly. 

He crouched now beneath a jutting 
knot of brambles beside the warrior den. 
The night was cold, and his sodden fur 
did little to keep out the chill. The rain 
pounded the clearing. Snowbird and 
Scorchfur were patrolling the borders. 
The rest of his Clanmates had long since 


withdrawn to their dens. Tigerheart 
didn’t want to go to his nest yet. He 
didn’t want to listen to Stonewing and 
Grassheart snoring. He knew he 
wouldn’t sleep. Worry about Dovewing 
would crowd his thoughts the moment he 
closed his eyes. It pricked at his belly 
now. Had she found somewhere safe and 
dry to shelter for the night? Perhaps she 
was keeping ahead of this relentless 
rain. 

He saw two shapes move outside 
Rowanstar’s den. 

“Go and talk to him.” Tawnypelt’s 
mew was muffled by the downpour. 
Tigerheart saw her nudge Rowanstar 
toward him. 


As his father approached, he 
straightened and sat up, curling his tail 
tightly around his paws. Rain streamed 
from his whiskers. 

“You shouldn’t have interfered.” 
Rowanstar stopped in front of him. 

Tigerheart could see anger still 
burning in his father’s gaze and, behind 
it, hurt. “I’m sorry.” He dipped his head. 
He might have been right about the 
rabbit, but he knew how much he’d 
humiliated his father by stepping 
between his Clanmates and SkyClan. “I 
just didn’t want to see anyone get hurt.” 
He wondered if he should remind him 
that it would be a good idea to stay 
friendly with SkyClan. He decided to 


appeal to Rowanstar’s kindness instead. 
“After all we suffered with Darktail, I 
didn’t want to see more cats wounded.” 

Rowanstar seemed to flinch; the 
memory clearly pained him “I 
understand how you feel, Tigerheart. 
You care about your Clanmates. You are 
a good warrior, but leading a Clan that 
has been torn apart by rogues is hard 
enough. Leading a Clan when your son 
and deputy publicly challenges your 
decisions is impossible.” He gazed at 
Tigerheart, his eyes glittering solemnly 
in the darkness. 

“I didn’t mean to undermine you,” 
Tigerheart meowed quickly. “I just 
wanted to do what was right.” 


Rowanstar held his gaze. “Your plan 
worked. SkyClan promised to return 
what they stole and everyone was left 
unscathed.” He stared at the muddy earth 
for a moment before lifting his gaze to 
meet Tigerheart’s once more. “I am 
proud of you. I know that one day you 
will be a great leader. But it is hard to 
be eclipsed.” 

Sympathy welled in Tigerheart’s 
chest. Rowanstar wanted to do the best 
for his Clan, but he didn’t always seem 
to know how. Had it always been this 
way? Had he been out of his depth since 
StarClan named him leader? Perhaps I 
was too young to realize until now. 
Tigerheart gazed softly at his father. 


“How did you know you wanted to be 
leader?” 

Rowanstar blinked back at him. “I’m 
not sure I did. But when Blackstar made 
me deputy, I realized the difference 
between being a leader and a warrior.” 
Tigerheart leaned forward, pricking his 
ears as Rowanstar went on. “A leader’s 
loyalty and heart lie with his Clan. A 
warrior’s loyalty and heart lie with his 
leader.” His gaze seemed to reach deep 
into Tigerheart, tugging guilt from his 
belly. He 5 telling me to trust him. But 
how can I when I know better? When 
the sun is strong, the shadows are 
strong. 

“Do you want to lead this Clan?” 


Rowanstar’s blunt question took him 
by surprise. Had his eyes betrayed his 
thoughts? 

“Wh-when my time comes,” 
Tigerheart stammered. “But there’s no 
need to think of that now. You have 
moons left.” 

“I mean now.” Rowanstar’s gaze 
remained steady. “Leaders have stepped 
down before and handed leadership to 
their deputy if it’s what is best for the 
Clan. I will support you if you wish to 
take my place. I can see that you are 
strong and wise, despite your youth. If 
you are ready to lead, I won’t stand in 
your way.” 

Tigerheart could hardly believe his 


99 


ears. “Now?” Suddenly the rain seemed 
to harden, filling his eyes and his nose, 
pressing in on every side until Tigerheart 
felt he was drowning. Leader? The 
responsibility snatched his breath. Every 
cat in the Clan would look to him for 
guidance, and rely on him to protect 
them. And I’d never be able to join 
Dovewing. His heart seemed to split 
with pain. His paws ached to run from 
the camp and keep running until he could 
escape from the endless rain and 
responsibility and think only of her and 
his kits. 

He realized Rowanstar was staring 
at him questioningly. “I—I .. .” He 
could do no more than stutter. 


“You arent ready,’ Rowanstar 
answered for him gently. He dipped his 
head sympathetically. “You are still 
young and inexperienced. It takes 
courage to lead.” 


“Pm not scared,” Tigerheart 
meowed quickly. “But there are other 
things I have to think about—” 


Rowanstar hardly seemed to hear 
him. He seemed caught up in his own 
thoughts. “But if you don’t wish to lead, 
then you must learn to follow.” He lifted 
his chin, as though unaware of the 
lashing rain. “When I make a decision, 
you must obey. No arguing. No 
contradicting. You must follow me 
without question.” 


Tigerheart nodded. What else could 
he do but agree? If he refused to lead, 
then he couldn’t undermine his leader. “I 
can do that,” he promised. 

“I hope so,” Rowanstar meowed 
gravely. With a flick of his tail, he turned 
away and stalked back to Tawnypelt, 
who was waiting outside his den. 
Together they disappeared into its 
shelter. 

Tigerheart crossed the clearing. He 
wanted to look up at the open sky, where 
the branches of the encircling trees 
didn’t touch. He stared at the gloomy 
clouds, which hid the night sky, and 
breathed deeply through the rain. He’d 
had a chance to lead ShadowClan. 


Should he have taken it? 

As doubt swirled around him, paw 
steps sounded at the camp entrance. 

Scorchfur and Snowbird padded into 
camp. Scorchfur was carrying a rabbit 
between his jaws. He dropped it at 
Tigerheart’s paws. “SkyClan left this at 
the border.” 

Snowbird looked at the rain-soaked 
rabbit. “I guess the argument is settled.” 

“You were right to stop the battle.” 
Scorchfur dipped his head to Tigerheart. 
“You showed SkyClan that ShadowClan 
deserves respect without blood being 
shed.” 

Snowbird glanced around the 
deserted clearing. “Rowanstar would 


have let us fight,’ she breathed in a 
hushed mew. “Puddleshine would be 
treating our injuries right now. But we 
have a rabbit instead of wounds because 
of you.” 

Scorchfur nodded. “If you’d been 
leader in the first place, ShadowClan 
wouldn’t be in the state it is now.” 

Tigerheart stiffened. “That’s not true. 
Rowanstar hasn’t caused our suffering. 
That was Darktail’s fault.” 

“If we'd had a strong leader, 
Darktail would never have been able to 
take over,” Snowbird argued. 

“Rowanstar doesn’t know how to 
lead,” Scorchfur agreed. “From now on, 
we will only take our orders from you.” 


Tigerheart’s belly tightened. No! 
He’d just promised his father he 
wouldn’t undermine him. “You can’t—” 
But Snowbird was already heading to 
her den. Scorchfur had picked up the 
rabbit and was carrying it to the fresh- 
kill pile. 

I’m not leader, but I must lead. 
Tigerheart’s thoughts spun. Without 
letting Rowanstar see what I’m doing. 
How was that possible? He felt trapped, 
tangled by the need to help his 
Clanmates while honoring his father. 
Would he ever be able to escape 
ShadowClan’s plight? What about 
Dovewing? What about my Clan? His 
heart ached while questions twisted his 


thoughts into knots. What about me ? Am 
I destined to be alone, separated 
forever from Dovewing and my kits? 





CHAPTER 9 
Cog 


Tigerheart shifted in his nest. Snowbird 
and Scorchfur’s words earlier that night 
still rang in his ears. From now on, we 
will only take our orders from you. The 
den was damp. The moss at the bottom 
of his nest was soaked with rain. It 
chilled his pelt. Stonewing and 
Grassheart breathed softly beside him, 
lost in sleep. Strikestone turned in his 
nest with a grunt and began to snore. 
Tigerheart pushed himself deeper into 
his nest and tried to sleep. 

What should he do? He couldn’t 
please everyone. The cats he cared 


about all wanted something different 
from him. Dovewing wanted a mate; his 
unborn kits needed a father; Rowanstar 
needed his obedience; his Clanmates 
wanted his leadership. He couldn’t help 
one cat without hurting another. 

StarClan, guide me! He sat up in his 
nest, staring at the roof of the warriors’ 
den. The stars were so far away, above 
the brambles, above the rain, beyond the 
thick clouds. Could his ancestors even 
see what was happening? 

What does my instinct tell me? 
Protect my kits. Protect my Clanmates. 
Protect my father. How could he do all 
three? My dream. He pictured the sun 
shining on his pelt, his shadow stretching 


darkly behind him. Was there guidance 
in the vision that he’d failed to 
understand? 

Puddleshine will know. 

Tigerheart stepped softly from his 
nest and slid from the den. He hurried 
through the pouring rain to Puddleshine’s 
den. Gentle snoring sounded inside as 
Tigerheart ducked through the narrow 
entrance. In the darkness he could just 
make out Puddleshine’s shape in his 
nest. Tigerheart approached quietly and 
stood beside him. “Puddleshine,” he 
breathed, wanting to wake the cat gently. 

Puddleshine’s eyes opened sharply. 
The medicine cat leaped up and 
scrambled to the back of his nest. 


Hissing, he narrowed his eyes 
defensively. 

Tigerheart stiffened with alarm. Why 
was Puddleshine so scared? “It’s me. 
It’s okay. Everything’s fine,” he soothed. 

Puddleshine blinked at him, his 
arched spine dropping as he relaxed. 
Pelt ruffled, the brown tom hopped from 
his nest, his white splotches glowing 
faintly in the gloom. “Sorry,” he 
mumbled thickly. “I was dreaming. A cat 
was looming over me in the dream, and I 
woke up and you were . . .” His mew 
trailed away as though thoughts 
distracted him. His gaze dropped for a 
moment; then he stiffened. “It was you!” 
He blinked at Tigerheart. “You were the 


cat I was dreaming about.” 

Alarm jabbed Tigerheart’s chest. 
Had StarClan sent a sign after all? 

“You were standing in front of me. I 
felt cold, even though the sun was 
shining. There was blue sky, but I felt 
chilly. . . .” He shivered. “Like the 
coldness of a cave that has never felt the 
warmth of the sun.” 

“The sun?” Tigerheart echoed, his 
moth dry. Another dream about the sun. 
“What was I doing?” 

“You stood over me, dark and huge, 
and I realized that the sun was streaming 
all around you. But you were blocking 
it.” Puddleshine’s mew slowed 
thoughtfully. “You were blocking the 


sunshine.” 

Tigerheart stared at him, his thoughts 
flitting to his own dream. His pelt had 
shimmered in the sunshine. But the 
shadow I cast was darker than anything 
else in the camp. Suddenly he knew 
what the dream meant. He wasn’t the sun 
after all! He was getting in the way of 
the sun! Hadn’t his father faded in the 
dream? “I shouldn’t be here,” he mewed. 
Regret choked him as the idea cut 
through his muddled thoughts as clearly 
as the warning screech of a magpie. 
He’d let Dovewing leave without him 
for nothing. He’d wasted so much time. 
“If the sun is to be strong and the 
shadows are to be strong, I must go.” 


“No!” Puddleshine leaned toward 
him. “You were casting a shadow, that’s 
all. Isn’t that what we need? Yours was 
the strongest shadow of all.” 

Tigerheart hardly heard him. His 
own thoughts were spinning, faster and 
faster. No wonder he’d been confused. 
So many mixed messages. How could he 
support his father and lead his 
Clanmates at the same time? Of course it 
was impossible. He shouldn’t even be 
here. He should be at Dovewing’s side. 
The longer he stayed, the harder it would 
be for his father to lead ShadowClan 
back to greatness. 

“Tigerheart!” Puddleshine’s eyes 
gleamed in the darkness. “ShadowClan 


needs you.” 

Tigerheart blinked at him. “Don’t 
worry, Puddleshine. I know exactly what 
to do.” He dipped his head to the 
medicine cat. “Thank you for helping 
me.” 

“Where are you going?” Puddleshine 
called as Tigerheart turned to leave the 
den. 

“I need to get some sleep,” 
Tigerheart told him. It was true. He 
hadn’t slept well in days. But he wasn’t 
going to sleep now. He had something 
far more important to do. “Go back to 
your nest,” he told Puddleshine, and 
hurried out into the rain. 

He scanned the clearing. There was 


no sign of movement. He could only 
smell the warm scent of sleeping cats 
curled in damp nests. He checked 
Puddleshine’s den. The medicine cat 
hadn’t followed him out. He pricked his 
ears and heard the rustle of 
Puddleshine’s nest as the tom climbed 
back into it. 

Dipping his head in farewell to his 
sleeping Clan, he crept quietly to the 
camp entrance. He slunk through the 
tunnel and padded softly into the forest. 
Only when he was clear of the camp and 
felt sure the pounding of the rain would 
disguise the sound of his paw steps did 
he break into a run. /’m coming, 
Dovewing. For the first time in days, his 


heart felt light. It chimed in harmony 
with his thoughts. He raced for the 
Thunderpath, like a bird flying for 
warmer lands, not knowing what his 
journey held, but certain that he must 
make it—that making it was the most 
natural thing he could do. Somewhere, 
far beyond the Thunderpath, Dovewing 
was managing alone. He was going to 
find her and, in another moon, welcome 
his kits to their new home in the strange 
gorse-spined den. 





CHAPTER 10 
Cog 


Tigerheart slept for a while before 
dawn. He had crossed the silent 
Thunderpath easily and let the landscape 
guide him because he guessed that was 
what Dovewing would have done. The 
marshland had led to fields. Hedgerows 
had led to valleys, which skirted hills 
and drew him on over farmland where 
ridges and hollows seemed to create 
natural paths. All the while he had 
prayed to StarClan that he was heading 
the right way, imagining what Dovewing 
might see and trying to follow her paw 
steps, trying not to think of the hurt that 


must have clouded her thoughts as she’d 
traveled. He had left her to make this 
journey alone. /’m sorry, Dovewing. I’m 
coming now. 

The days of rain had washed all 
scents clean, and there was nothing to 
guide him but hope. As he’d sensed 
dawn easing the darkness, he’d found 
shelter in a rocky outcrop and slept. 
Daylight had woken him, and he’d 
hunted and caught a mouse. It had 
warmed him and refreshed his hope that 
Dovewing lay ahead. 

He pushed on, his heart lifting as he 
saw clear sky opening beyond the gray 
clouds ahead. As he padded clear of the 
rain shadow that had drenched the forest 


for so long, sunshine warmed his pelt. 
Before long, he felt drier than he had for 
days. He fluffed out his fur happily. 
ShadowClan was far behind him, and 
with every paw step he felt lighter. The 
worry that had felt like a weight in his 
chest for so long slowly lifted. He 
would find Dovewing, even if he had to 
walk forever. 

As the sun began to slide toward the 
horizon, throwing lazy shadows across 
his path, he saw a Twolegplace 
sprawling across the valley ahead. It 
cluttered the hollow between the 
enclosing hills with low stone nests, and 
he could make out a maze of 
Thunderpaths weaving through it. 


Instinct told him to go around, but where 
there were Twoleg nests, there were 
kittypets. And kittypets might know of 
the gorse-spined den Dovewing had seen 
in her dream. Fluffing his fur against the 
deepening chill of the afternoon, he 
turned his paws toward the 
Twolegplace. 

He crossed a meadow edged by 
Twoleg nests. Twoleg smells reached his 
nose as soon as he neared the small 
patches of fenced land that lay behind 
them. Monster stench rolled over him. 
Strange food scents confused him. How 
could any cat hunt when prey-scent was 
hidden by such unnatural odors? 

Perhaps that was why kittypets ate 


the food their Twolegs gave them. 

As he wondered about kittypets, a 
thought lit him with hope. Dovewing 
might have come this way in search of 
information about the gorse-spined den, 
just as he had. A kittypet might have 
spoken to her. He’d know for sure that 
he was traveling in the right direction. 
He reached a wooden fence and jumped. 
Hooking in his claws, he hauled himself 
up, sending splinters of sharp-smelling 
wood showering down behind him. At 
the top, he warily surveyed the patches 
of green behind each Twoleg nest. Birds 
twittered in the trees, which sprouted 
here and there among the patches. His 
fur smoothed along his spine with relief. 


There were no Twolegs, and no scent of 
dog. No kittypets either. He frowned. 
He’d have to push deeper into the 
Twolegplace to find a cat to ask about 
Dovewing. He spotted an opening 
between the two closest nests, jumped 
down, and crossed the grass. Ears 
pricked, he pushed past a bush and 
slipped into the shadowy gap. 

He crept through it, relieved to see 
light at the end of a stone-lined path. He 
hurried along it, his pelt prickling. 
Monsters were rumbling in the distance. 
The whooping of Twoleg kits pierced 
his ear fur. He slowed as he reached the 
end of the gap and peered out uneasily. A 
Thunderpath ran between two rows of 


nests. Stretches of grass, dotted by 
bushes and young trees, lay beside it. 
Had Dovewing been here? Longing 
seared his heart. He should have been 
with her. He tasted the air, wrinkling his 
nose. There was no familiar smell to 
guide him, but he couldn’t stay where he 
was. He darted from the shadows and 
hurried that way, ducking beneath a low- 
spreading willow as a monster growled 
along the Thunderpath a few tail-lengths 
ahead. He crouched, waiting as it 
passed. 

His heart fluttered like a trapped 
bird. He just needed to find one friendly 
kittypet. 


Suddenly an excited mrrow sounded 


behind him. He spun. His pelt bushed as 
a soft bundle of fur flew at his face. It 
toppled clumsily over him and knocked 
him off his paws. As he rolled clear, he 
smelled kittypet. A tom, but a young one, 
his scent faint. Tigerheart darted from 
beneath the willow, and as the kittypet 
chased after him, he saw that it was a 
splotchy ginger tabby, thick-furred and 
hardly bigger than Whorlpaw. Its yellow 
eyes flashed excitedly. With a squeak, it 
reared for another lunge. Tigerheart 
batted it away. Was this how all kittypets 
fought? 

The ginger tabby seemed 
unconcerned by the clumsiness of his 
attacks. Paws fluttered around his ears 


like butterflies as Tigerheart ducked 
another flurry. Then the kittypet bounced 
around him, ears twitching, fur bushed. 
“Come on!” he mewed eagerly. “Fight 
back!” 

Tigerheart swallowed a purr. Did the 
kittypet seriously think this was a real 
fight? Tigerheart kept his claws sheathed 
as the tabby flung itself at him once 
more. He ducked the flailing paws and 
jabbed his nose beneath the kittypet’s 
belly. Flicking his head up, he flipped 
the tom onto its back. 

“Wow! Nice!” The _ kittypet 
scrambled to its paws and turned on 
Tigerheart. It ducked beneath 
Tigerheart’s belly as though trying to 


copy his move, but when it tried to push 
up, Tigerheart hopped neatly out of the 
way. The kittypet spun. “Where’d you 
go?” 

“Pm over here.” Tigerheart sat down 
and watched the befuddled tabby drop 
into an ungainly attack crouch. He lifted 
a paw as the tabby began to wiggle its 
hindquarters. “Stop.” 

The tabby blinked at him. “Why? Am 
I winning?” 

Tigerheart eyed him. “Pm not 
looking for a fight,” he meowed. 

The tabby paused. “But I was 
winning, right?” 

Something seemed to catch the 
tabby’s eye, because his gaze flashed to 


the Twoleg den behind Tigerheart. His 
pelt fluffed excitedly. “Got to go!” he 
mewed. “Let’s fight again soon.” 

Before Tigerheart could speak, the 
kittypet hared past him, leaped a stretch 
of small shrubs, and disappeared into the 
shadows between two nests. 

Tigerheart stared after him. What 
was that all about? If the kittypet was 
defending its border, then it wasn’t very 
good at it. Perhaps it was just hoping to 
scare him off. Did the tabby think that a 
few soft jabs were enough to scare a 
warrior away? Kittypets must have bees 
in their brain. He shook out his pelt and 
crossed the grass. Following the 
Thunderpath, he skirted the row of 


Twoleg nests. The sun was slipping 
toward the hillside. 

“Hi.” A gentle mew made him stop. 
He looked toward the Twoleg nest 
where the voice had sounded. A pale 
cream she-cat was crouched on a wide 
wooden ledge jutting from the front. She 
glanced down at him, her fluffy tail 
twitching at the tip. “You’re not from 
around here. Are you lost?” 

Tigerheart eyed the kittypet and saw 
softness in her gaze. “I’m looking for 
someone.” He padded toward the ledge 
and blinked at her hopefully. “A gray cat 
called Dovewing. Have you seen her? 
She might have passed this way a few 
days ago. She was looking for a den 


with spikes on the roof like gorse 
spines.” 

The  kittypet looked puzzled. 
“Spikes?” 

“It’s in a Twolegplace where the 
nests reach into the sky,” Tigerheart 
explained. 

The kittypet glanced at the low 
Twoleg nests surrounding hers. “It won’t 
be here, then,” she mewed 
apologetically. 

“Perhaps you saw Dovewing?” 
Tigerheart’s belly ached with hope as he 
searched the  kittypet’s face for 
recognition. 

“Fight!” An excited yowl sounded 
behind him, and he turned to see the 


ginger tabby rushing toward him once 
more. 

Frustration spiked Tigerheart’s pelt. 
Not you again! He reared to meet the 
tom’s attack, flipped the kittypet’s hind 
paws from beneath him with a swipe of 
one paw, and knocked him to the ground 
with another. He pinned him there, his 
claws sheathed, his paws buried deep in 
the tabby’s fluffy pelt. The kittypet was 
so soft it was like pressing into moss. 

“Hey!” the  kittypet wailed 
indignantly, trying to wriggle free of 
Tigerheart’s grip. 

“I don’t have time to fight,” 
Tigerheart meowed firmly. “I’m looking 
for someone. If I let you up, will you 


back off?” 

The kittypet squirmed. “But why? 
Pm having fun!” 

“Just back off,” Tigerheart growled. 

The kittypet stopped squirming. 
“Okay.” 

Tigerheart let him go. 

The kittypet leaped to his paws and 
backed away, his eyes bright. “That was 
an awesome move,” he mewed. “Can 
you show me how you did it?” 

“I said I don’t have time.” 
Tigerheart’s pelt prickled with irritation. 
Every moment that passed, Dovewing 
was getting further away. 

“Do you need to get back to your 
Twolegs?” the kittypet tom asked. 


“I don’t have Twolegs,” Tigerheart 
told him. “I’m a warrior.” 

“A warrior!” The kittypet’s eyes 
widened in wonder. “That’s why you 
fight so good. ve heard about warriors. 
Have you been one for long?” 

“Since I was born.” Tigerheart 
supposed that was a bit inaccurate— 
he’d been a kit and an apprentice first— 
but that didn’t seem worth explaining to 
this kittypet, whose eyes widened with 
interest. 

“Do you live in the wild?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why?” 

Tigerheart paused. What a mouse- 
brained question. “Why do you live with 


Twolegs?” 

But the kittypet seemed more 
interested in Tigerheart’s life than his 
own. “Don’t you get cold and hungry?” 

“Sometimes.” 

“Do you really fight foxes and 
badgers?” 

“When we have to.” Tigerheart’s 
pelt rippled along his spine. This was 
taking too long. 

“Fuzzball,” the she-cat cut in gently, 
clearly sensing Tigerheart’s impatience. 
“Give hima break.” 

“Fuzzball?” Tigerheart’s whiskers 
twitched in surprise. “Is that your 
name?” 

Fuzzball blinked at him “Of 


99 


course.” 

Didn’t this kittypet mind having such 
a dumb name? Tigerheart stared at him. 
“ve never heard of a cat called 
Fuzzball before.” 

“Whats your name?” Fuzzball 
asked. 

“Tigerheart.” 

The ginger tabby’s eyes widened, 
impressed. “That’s a great name!” He 
blinked at the she-cat. “Tigerheart.” 
Saying the name seemed to please him, 
and he purred. “I want to be called 
Tigerheart.” 

The she-cat blinked at him fondly. “I 
think Fuzzball suits you better.” 

“Not as much as Tigerheart would!” 


As Fuzzball puffed out his chest, the 
she-cat dipped her head to Tigerheart. 
“My name is Rose. I’m sorry we can’t 
help you find your friend, but you said 
that she was looking for a place with 
nests that reach the sky.” She turned to 
Fuzzball. “Do you know where that is?” 

Fuzzball looked pleased to be asked. 
“No.” He blinked at Tigerheart. “But 
Ajax might. He told me that he and his 
Twolegs once lived in a den so high he 
could look down at the birds.” 

Tigerheart pressed back a shudder. 
Why would anything without wings want 
to live in the sky? 

“Come on.” Fuzzball headed around 
the side of the Twoleg nest. “Ill take 


you to Ajax.” 

Tigerheart nodded quickly to Rose. 
“Thanks for your help.” 

She tipped her head. “Good luck!” 
she called as he followed Fuzzball. “I 
hope you find your friend.” 

Fuzzball wasn’t a good fighter, but 
he did know how to travel through 
Twoleg territory. Tigerheart hurried to 
keep up as the ginger kittypet led him 
through a maze of paths and tracks that 
wove between Twoleg nests, over 
grassy clearings, and around fences. The 
tom showed no fear as he dodged 
beneath monsters sleeping in front of 
nests and slid between them as they 
dozed beside Thunderpaths. 


“Here,” he meowed, stopping at last 
on the grassy square behind a yellow 
Twoleg nest. While Tigerheart caught his 
breath, overwhelmed by the countless 
new scents that filled his nose and 
distracted by noises he didn’t recognize, 
Fuzzball lifted his muzzle and yowled. 
“Ajax!” He looked expectantly at the 
nest. 

A moment later, a clear flap clattered 
open near the bottom and a burly black- 
and-white tom squeezed out. He lifted 
his tail as he saw Fuzzball. “Hey, Fuzz! 
Are you looking for a fight?” His eyes 
sparked warmly. 

“Not today,” Fuzzball purred back. 
“Although this cat could teach you a 


thing or two about fighting. He totally 
beat me.” 

“Rose could beat you in a fight,” 
Ajax teased. 

Fuzzball flicked his tail. “One day 
I’m going to be the best fighter in the 
neighborhood.” 

Ajax wove around him, brushing 
pelts with the fluffy tom. “Perhaps,” he 
conceded. “But you need to spend less 
time at your food dish and more time 
patrolling your territory.” 

Tigerheart’s ears pricked in surprise. 
“Do kittypets patrol territory too?” 

Ajax swung his wide head toward 
Tigerheart and narrowed his eyes. “Of 
course. If we have territory to patrol.” 


“But youre not warriors,” 
Tigerheart pointed out. 

“What’s a warrior?” Ajax poked his 
muzzle forward and sniffed Tigerheart. 

“Havent you heard of warriors?” 
Fuzzball whisked his tail. He seemed 
happy to know more than his friend. 
“They’re strays that live in the wild.” 

Ajax blinked sympathetically at 
Tigerheart. “Couldn’t you find a Twoleg 
to take you in?” 

Tigerheart’s pelt bristled. “I 
wouldn’t want a Twoleg to take me in.” 

Fuzzball lifted his muzzle. “He likes 
being a stray.” 

“A warrior,” Tigerheart corrected. 

“Well, whatever you are. . .” Ajax 


circled him slowly. “You look lost.” 

Tigerheart warily eyed the Twoleg 
den behind Ajax. What if a Twoleg came 
out? “I’m traveling somewhere to find a 
friend,” he explained. 

“His friend was heading for a place 
with nests that reach to the sky, like the 
one you used to live in,” Fuzzball told 
Ajax. 

“She had a dream that told her there 
was a den there with a spiky roof,” 
Tigerheart added. 

“She?” Ajax exchanged meaningful 
looks with Fuzzball. “Is this a romantic 
quest?” He didn’t wait for an answer. “Tf 
you're looking for romance, there are 
plenty of she-cats here.” 


“This one’s special.” Tigerheart’s 
pelt prickled hotly. Didn’t kittypets fall 
in love? 

“Whatever.” Ajax shrugged. “If your 
friend was heading for a place with sky- 
high nests, she was probably looking for 
the Twolegplace I come from.” The 
black-and-white tom glanced at his 
Twoleg nest disdainfully. “It’s way 
bigger than this place. I used to live ina 
huge den filled with Twoleg nests. From 
the window, the Thunderpaths below 
looked tiny. Everything looked tiny. 
Twolegs looked like prey from up there. 
Even the monsters looked like prey.” 

Tigerheart swallowed. Dovewing 
was in a place where the dens reached 


so high that the monsters looked tiny. He 
had to get to her. “Is there a den there 
with big spikes like gorse thorns on the 
roof?” 

Ajax narrowed his eyes. “Like gorse 
thorns?” He seemed to be thinking. “That 
sounds like a Twoleg gathering place.” 

Tigerheart blinked at him confused. 

“I could see a gathering place from 
my old home,” Ajax told him. “Every 
quarter moon, Twolegs would go there 
and yowl together.” 

“Why?” Fuzzball asked. 

“It’s something Twolegs do.” Ajax 
sniffed. 

Tigerheart’s heart sparked with 
hope. Dovewing had been right. There 


was a gorse-spiked den. He was heading 
the right way. “How do I get to that 
Twolegplace?” he asked Ajax. 

Ajax looked over his shoulder at his 
Twoleg nest, then swished his tail. 
“Follow me. P11 show you.” 

As he headed across the patch of 
grass behind the nest, Fuzzball glanced 
nervously at Tigerheart. “Are you sure 
you want to go there?” 

Tigerheart nodded. “I have to.” 

Ajax called to them from across the 
grass. “Are you two coming?” 

Tigerheart hurried toward him. He 
let the two kittypets take the lead. They 
were clearly more skillful at dodging 
Twolegs and monsters. They kept to 


shadowy gaps between nests, and when 
they needed to cross a Thunderpath, they 
knew exactly when to dart between the 
monsters. When they saw Twolegs on the 
pathways, they slipped around them, 
ducking nimbly if a Twoleg bent to touch 
them. 

“If you can learn to dodge Twolegs 
and monsters like that,” Tigerheart 
puffed as they reached a clear stretch of 
grass on the outskirts of the 
Twolegplace, “you can learn to fight.” 

Fuzzball blinked at him hopefully. 
“Do you really think so?” 

“Sure.” Tigerheart looked back in 
relief at the dens and paths that cluttered 
the landscape behind him. “You just 


need to work out a few battle moves and 
practice them until you can do them 
without thinking.” 

Fuzzball purred. 

Ajax was padding on, crossing the 
scruffy grass. Tigerheart followed him. 
He could see two shiny tracks cutting 
across the scrubland ahead. A few tree- 
lengths away, a small nest sat on a wide 
stone ledge that edged the track squarely. 
Ajax stopped and nodded toward it. 
“That’s where Twolegs wait for the 
Thundersnake to arrive.” 

“Thundersnake?” Tigerheart pelt 
prickled with unease. “What’s that?” 

Ajax stared at him “You don’t 
know? Are you kidding?” 


Tigerheart fluffed out his fur self- 
consciously. “We don’t have 
Thundersnakes in the forest.” 

Fuzzball padded between him and 
Ajax. “A Thundersnake is a huge 
monster that travels along the 
Silverpath.” He nodded toward the shiny 
tracks that lay a few tail-lengths in front 
of them. 

“The Silverpath leads to the big 
Twolegplace.” Ajax added. “That’s why 
the Twolegs are waiting. When the 
Thundersnake arrives, they’ll climb into 
its belly and let it carry them there.” 

Climb into its belly? Shuddering 
with horror, Tigerheart followed his 
gaze and saw Twolegs milling on the 


ledge now. Some were gazing eagerly 
along the track. Others hung back or 


paced. Tigerheart could sense 
impatience in the Twolegs’ restless 
movements. “How long till the 


Thundersnake comes?” 

“Soon.” Ajax turned his head and 
looked expectantly along the shiny 
tracks. 

Tigerheart watched the Twolegs on 
the ledge. One of them put down the 
heavy bundle it was carrying and 
crouched beside it. The Twoleg used its 
forepaws to open up the bundle, 
revealing colorful pelts crammed inside. 
“What’s that?” Tigerheart nudged Ajax. 

Ajax turned to look. “It’s a shell,” he 


grunted. “Twolegs use them to carry 
their spare pelts around.” He stiffened 
and looked back along the track. “The 
Thundersnake’s coming.” 

Tigerheart followed his gaze. His 
ears twitched as the tracks began to hum. 
He felt the air tremble around them as 
their vibration grew stronger. Suddenly a 
monster appeared where the tracks 
dipped behind a ridge. It rumbled 
toward them like a storm. 

Tigerheart’s paws froze in fear. The 
Thundersnake was huge—far bigger than 
any monster he’d seen before. The earth 
shook as it pounded closer. Its paws 
carved a path along the tracks, which 
seemed to scream beneath its weight. He 


glanced at Ajax and Fuzzball. Why 
weren’t they running away? He held his 
ground beside them, fighting the urge to 
flee as the Thundersnake screamed 
closer. It roared past them like forest 
fire. Hot air blasted from its flanks, 
which flashed by, flank after flank, until 
Tigerheart wondered if the 
Thundersnake would ever end. He 
narrowed his eyes against its choking 
stench and dug his claws into the earth. 
Its wind tore at his pelt, and he flattened 
his ears against its deafening howl. Stiff 
with terror, he held his breath as the 
world seemed to explode around him. 
Was this really where Dovewing’s 
dream was supposed to lead? 





CHAPTER 11 
Cog 


Tigerheart pressed himself against the 
earth, trying not to tremble as the 
Thundersnake’s long tail slowed a short 
distance in front of him. Finally its 
flanks drew level with the stone ledge, 
and the creature rumbled to a halt. The 
waiting Twolegs didn’t flinch as it 
growled to itself beside the ledge. How 
could they be so calm? Twolegs were 
even stranger than he thought. When gaps 
opened in the side, the Twolegs on the 
ledge shifted away as other Twolegs 
streamed out, then began to push past 
them and climb into the belly of the 


snake. Tigerheart’s pelt bristled with 
fear. Why were they so trusting? Did 
they really believe the Thundersnake 
would let them out of its belly when they 
reached the Twolegplace? What if it was 
hungry? 

“Quick!” Ajax hissed in Tigerheart’s 
ear. “If you run, you can get inside.” 

Tigerheart stared at him in horror. 

“Go on!” Ajax nudged him toward 
the ledge. “You have to get in before it 
closes back up. Then the Thundersnake 
will take you to the Twolegplace.” 

“Tm not getting into the belly of a 
Thundersnake!” Tigerheart blinked at 
him. 

“Twolegs do it all the time,” Ajax 


argued. 

“But Twolegs are crazy,” Tigerheart 
pointed out. 

“He’s right,” Fuzzball agreed. 

“I’ve been inside a Thundersnake,” 
Ajax reminded them. 

“And it let you out?” 

“Of course.” 

“What was it like inside?” 
Tigerheart couldn’t imagine it had been 
safe. 

Ajax looked thoughtful for a moment. 
“It was loud and smelly and full of 
Twolegs. And my Twoleg carried me in 
a cage.” He shifted his paws. “Okay. It 
wasn’t the best day of my life, but I 
survived, and how else are you going to 


get to the Twolegplace?” 

“PIH walk.” 

“It'll take forever.” Ajax stared at 
him. The Thundersnake suddenly hooted 
and began to shudder. “Hurry!” He 
flicked his tail. “It’s about to leave.” 

“Good.” Tigerheart glanced toward 
the Thundersnake, relieved as the gaps 
closed. He let his fur smooth as the great 
creature began to pull away from the 
ledge. 

“You can’t walk all the way to 
where you’re going,” Ajax argued. “It’s 
too far.” 

“I can walk anywhere,” he told Ajax. 
“My Clan once walked over a mountain 
range to find a new home.” 


Ajax shrugged. “I don’t know who 
your Clan is, but they sound as crazy as 
Twolegs.” 

“They sound awesome.” Fuzzball 
was Staring at him, wide-eyed. “Are they 
your family?” 

“Some of them.” A pang of loss 
jabbed Tigerheart’s belly as he thought 
of Rowanstar and Tawnypelt. He might 
never see them again. He changed the 
subject. “Pll follow the Silverpath. It 
will take longer, but I trust my own paws 
more than I trust a Thundersnake.” 

Ajax shrugged. “If that’s what you 
want.” The black-and-white tom looked 
at the sky. The sun was sliding toward 
the hilltop behind them. “When will you 


leave?” 

“You can stay with my Twolegs 
tonight,” Fuzzball offered. “They feed 
strays.” His tail twitched. “I’m always 
having to share my food.” 

“Warriors can feed themselves.” 
Tigerheart meowed pointedly. He 
scanned the scrubland. The low-growing 
shrubs were bathed in golden light. Prey 
would be moving between them. He 
blinked at the two kittypets. He was 
grateful for their help, even if they did 
keep calling him a stray. “Thanks for the 
offer, Fuzzball, but I want to leave soon. 
I'll eat here first, though.” 

“How?” Fuzzball blinked at him. 
“There aren’t any food dishes here.” 


“Who needs food dishes?” 
Tigerheart whisked his tail. “Let’s hunt.” 

“Catch our own food?” Ajax looked 
unconvinced. 

Fuzzball paced excitedly. “Hunt? Pd 
love to. Pve chased the birds in my 
garden and tracked a mouse once, but 
I’ve never caught anything.” 

“You will today.” Tigerheart dipped 
his head to the young tom. 

“I guess it sounds interesting.” Ajax 
wandered over the Silverpath, his fur 
gleaming in the afternoon sun, and 
headed onto the scrub. “Pd like to 
stretch my legs before I go home.” 

Tigerheart leaped over _ the 
Silverpath, careful not to touch it. It 


gleamed suspiciously, and stank of 
Thundersnake scent. Fuzzball followed 
him. On the other side, Tigerheart tasted 
the air. As the Thundersnake stench 
settled, he smelled the aroma of leaves 
and, breathing deeper, could just taste 
the musky scent of prey. He licked his 
lips. “Let’s go this way.” Keeping low, 
he pushed between two spiky bushes and 
followed a scuffed trail through the 
scrub. His nose twitched excitedly as the 
scent of prey grew stronger. He saw 
peck marks around the stems of the 
bushes and could smell that they were 
fresh. It must be a bird, a large one by 
the look of it. 

Fuzzball and Ajax set the bushes 


rustling behind him as they followed. 

“Are we tracking something?” 
Fuzzball asked loudly. 

“Hush!” Tigerheart glared at the 
kittypet over his shoulder. If he carried 
on yowling like that, he’d scare their 
prey away. 

Fuzzball looked apologetic and 
followed quietly for a few moments 
before yowling again. “I can smell 
something nice. Is that what we’re 
hunting?” 

Ahead, a fat grouse fluttered noisily 
into the air, its beating wings sending 
dust swirling over the scrub. 

Tigerheart flattened his ears in 
frustration. He turned on Fuzzball. 


“We’re not here to talk. We just hunt, 
okay?” he whispered through gritted 
teeth. He nodded to a side trail leading 
away between the bushes to one side. “I 
need you to go down there until you 
can’t see me anymore and then sit as 
quietly as you can and listen for 
badgers.” 

“Badgers?” Fuzzball frowned at him, 
puzzled. “There arent any badgers 
here.” 

“Then listen for foxes, or dogs.” 
Anything! Just keep out of my way. As 
he nodded Fuzzball away, he saw that 
Ajax had disappeared. He rolled his 
eyes as he thought, This is like leading a 
patrol of kits. Then he purred, 


remembering that he should try to get 
used to this. He would be seeing his own 
kits very soon, and—one day—he’d be 
teaching them how to hunt. “Where did 
Ajax go?” 

“T don’t know,” Fuzzball answered 
cheerfully. “I guess he got distracted. 
There are lots of good smells here.” He 
looked along the trail where Tigerheart 
had nodded. “So I go that way, right?” 

As he spoke, Tigerheart heard the 
thump of a rabbit’s paws. He stiffened, 
scanning the bushes for movement. 

Fuzzball raised his front paws off the 
ground and peered over the top of the 
bushes like a squirrel. “I see a rabbit! 
It’s over there!” With a yowl he plunged 


into the undergrowth. 

Pushing back frustration, Tigerheart 
strained to hear past Fuzzball as he 
crashed through bushes like a dog. 

Ajax ambled along the trail toward 
him. “Caught anything yet?” 

Tigerheart dug his claws into the 
earth. Why had he invited these two 
kittypets along? With all the noise they 
were making, he’d never catch any prey. 
He swallowed back irritation. Hunger 
was making him irritable. 

Fuzzball’s yowl split the air. “It’s 
heading toward you!” 

Tigerheart turned in surprise as 
brown fur flashed past him and 
disappeared between the bushes. He 


pelted after it, his fur prickling with 
excitement. The rabbit was plump but 
fast. It swerved beneath a sage bush. 
Tigerheart dived after it, his belly 
brushing the earth as he skidded under 
the low branches. The rabbit shot out the 
other side and veered toward the 
hillside, which sloped upward beside 
them. Tigerheart raced after it, fighting to 
keep his balance as he made a tight turn 
and cut across the rabbit’s path. It pulled 
up, its eyes wide with horror as it saw 
him. He slammed his paws onto its 
shoulders and made a fast killing bite. 
Paws pounded toward him. “You got 
it!” Fuzzball’s excited face popped out 
from the bushes. He stared in delight at 


Tigerheart’s catch. “7 flushed it out!” he 
announced proudly. 

Tigerheart looked at him, swiping 
the blood from his mouth with his 
tongue. “Yes, you did.” Fuzzball was a 
mouse-brain. But he was good-hearted. 
And at least they’d caught prey. He 
picked up the rabbit and carried it 
toward an open stretch of earth on the 
hillside. Laying it down, he settled 
beside it, relishing the warmth of the 
evening sun as it began to melt behind 
the far hill. 

As Fuzzball trotted after him and sat 
down, Ajax nosed his way from the 
bushes and sniffed the rabbit, his nose 
wrinkling. “What do we do now?” 


“We eat it.” Tigerheart leaned 
forward and tore a lump of flesh from 
the rabbit’s flank. It was warm and juicy 
in his mouth. “Try some.” He pushed it 
closer to Fuzzball. 

Fuzzball sniffed it gingerly, then 
grabbed a small mouthful. He chewed 
for a while and then mewed, with his 
mouth full, “It’s all fur.” He sounded 
disappointed. 

“Here.” Tigerheart grabbed the 
rabbit in his paws and tore away a hind 
leg with his teeth. He laid the bloody 
stump in front of Fuzzball. “There’s 
plenty of meat there.” 

Fuzzball stared at it, swallowed, 
then leaned close and took a second 


mouthful. He chewed unenthusiastically. 
“Is this what you eat all the time?” he 
asked warily, as though afraid of the 
answer. 

“Sometimes we eat mice or voles or 
birds,” Tigerheart told him. 

“Does it all taste like this?” He 
licked his lips clean and shuddered. 

“Not really.” How could any cat 
think a rabbit could taste like a mouse or 
a bird? 

Ajax sat down, keeping his distance 
from the rabbit. “I think P11 wait till I get 
home. It doesn’t smell like real food. 
And it looks a bit bloody.” 

“Of course it’s bloody. It’s prey.” 
Tigerheart blinked at him. Kittypets 


didn’t seem to enjoy anything about 
being a cat. He felt sorry for them. But 
they seemed happy, and he was happy 
too, here in the sunshine. The rabbit was 
tasty and it was all his. For once there 
were no Clanmates to share it with, and 
these kittypets didn’t seem to want any. 
If the journey was as long as Ajax had 
suggested, he’d need all his strength. He 
began to purr as he chewed. He’d found 
a trail that would lead him to Dovewing. 
He felt freer than he had in moons. His 
paws itched to begin the next part of his 
journey. 

Quickly, he finished his meal, 
gulping down most of the rabbit. The 
kittypets had given up eating and 


watched him in awed silence, as though 
they were watching a squirrel chew its 
own leg. 

He sat up and licked his lips, his 
belly full. “Thanks for your help.” He 
dipped his head to Ajax and Fuzzball. 

Ajax looked along the Silverpath, 
which followed the valley and curved 
behind a hill. “You’re really going to 
walk?” 

“Yes.” Tigerheart fluffed out his fur. 
For the first time he wondered if 
Dovewing had walked. Perhaps she’d 
found enough courage to climb into the 
Thundersnake’s belly. She 5 braver than 
me. Would she forgive him for not 
making the journey with her? What if he 


found her and she sent him away? She 
can t. They’re my kits too. He wanted to 
help her raise them. “I have to get 
going.” Standing here worrying wasn’t 
going to change anything. He headed 
toward the Silverpath. 

“Good-bye!” Fuzzball called after 
him. “When you come back, will you 
take me to meet your Clan?” 

Tigerheart glanced back at the 
orange tom, affection swelling in his 
chest. Dumb kittypet. He imagined the 
look on the faces of his Clanmates if he 
walked into camp with Fuzzball at his 
side. What if he tried to show them his 
hunting skills? Tigerheart’s whiskers 
twitched with amusement until a thought 


struck him like cold water. Would he 
ever walk into the ShadowClan camp 
again? Had he seen his Clanmates for the 
last time? 

He quickened his step, forcing his 
thoughts forward as he reached the 
Silverpath. He hopped between the 
tracks and followed them, picking his 
way over the wooden slats and between 
the scattered stone chips. Dovewing lay 
at the other end. He lifted his chin as the 
sun dipped behind the hill and cold 
shadow closed over him. 

By the time he’d followed the curve 
of the Silverpath around the foot of the 
hill, his paws were sore, grazed by the 
sharp stones. He jumped over a track 


and padded onto the grass at its edge. 
The grass was damp with dew and 
soothed his pads. The evening was 
deepening quickly into night. Stars 
specked the sky, and the moon showed, 
pale and distant. Tigerheart strained to 
see where the Silverpath led. It seemed 
to reach toward the hill rising ahead of 
him, but he couldn’t see its silver glint 
on the slope beyond it. Was a 
Thundersnake strong enough to haul 
itself up such a steep rise? 

As he neared, he realized that the 
path seemed to end as it reached the 
shadowy base of the hill. Anxiety 
churned in his belly. Was this a dead 
end? Had he followed the wrong 


Silverpath? As he neared, peering into 
the darkness, he realized with a jolt that 
the Silverpath disappeared into the 
hillside. He narrowed his eyes, making 
out an opening. Was this a Thundersnake 
den? Had it taken the Twolegs into its 
underground lair? He stiffened against 
the fear sparking beneath his pelt and 
forced himself to keep walking. Don t be 
such a kit, he told himself sternly. Why 
would Twolegs get into its belly? They 
must know where it was going. Ajax had 
been inside, and it had carried him from 
his old Twolegplace to here. /t must be 
a tunnel. Tigerheart relaxed a little. Of 
course its a tunnel. I just have to walk 
through it. 


Heart pounding, he approached the 
yawning hole. The utter blackness inside 
alarmed him. Did Dovewing come this 
way? He stepped into the darkness and 
shivered as it swallowed him. Pressing 
against the smooth stone wall of the 
tunnel, he used it to guide him. His gaze, 
usually so sharp in darkness, could make 
out nothing except more darkness. He put 
one paw gingerly in front of the other, 
acutely aware of his whisker tips as he 
felt for obstacles ahead. An icy breeze 
swept his pelt as wind streamed through 
the tunnel. He fluffed his fur against the 
chill, his heart pounding as he strained 
hopefully to see moonlight. 

As he walked, he glanced backward 


and saw that the opening behind him had 
disappeared into shadow. He was 
completely enclosed by darkness. A 
sound stirred his ear fur. He stiffened as 
he heard a low rumble. His whiskers 
quivered as the Silverpath beside him 
began to tremble. A light showed ahead. 
The end of the tunnel? Even as hope 
pricked in his belly, he knew he was 
wrong. The sour stench of a 
Thundersnake tainted the breeze. Its roar 
slowly grew as the light shone brighter. 
A Thundersnake was heading toward 
him. 

Tigerheart froze in terror. Was there 
room enough to hide? Jerking into 
action, he squeezed himself against the 


side of the tunnel and pressed down onto 
his belly so that he was flat against the 
earth. The breeze hardened, battering his 
face like freezing water. Even when he 
narrowed his eyes to slits, the glare of 
the Thundersnake’s single eye stung his 
gaze. Its roar grew until Tigerheart 
thought his ears would burst. He 
flattened them and pressed himself 
harder against the wall and the earth. 
Tucking his nose under his paws, he 
braced himself for the Thundersnake to 
strike. It tore past like a hurricane. The 
earth shook. The air screamed. The 
Thundersnake’s roar seemed to howl 
into every part of him until he felt that its 
fury would tear him apart. 


Then it was gone. The noise died; 
the wind dropped. For a moment, 
Tigerheart wondered if he’d been 
deafened. Then he heard water drip onto 
stone nearby. Limp with fear, he lay still 
until he stopped trembling. His heart 
slowed, and he steadied his breath. As 
he pushed himself shakily to his paws, 
exhilaration swept through him / 
survived. He’d never felt so close to 
death before. Is this what losing a life 
feels like to a Clan leader? 

He lifted his muzzle and padded on 
through the darkness, quickening his 
pace a little. He wanted to get to the end 
of this tunnel fast. Stubbing his claws on 
a stone in the dark would be far less 


awful than facing another Thundersnake. 

As he hurried on, praying for 
moonlight, a new scent touched his nose. 
He stopped, his heart quickening. He 
leaned down, quickly sniffing the 
ground. Fluff tickled his nose, its scent 
so familiar that his heart nearly burst 
with joy. Dovewing’s fur! No blood, no 
fear-scent, just a few strands of her pelt, 
as though she had stopped to scratch an 
itch and had left a shower of fur behind. 
She had come this way! Tigerheart’s 
chest seemed to burst with joy. He was 
on the right trail. Dovewing had to be 
waiting for him at the end. 





CHAPTER 12 
Cog 


Tigerheart woke, his heart pounding. 
He’d dreamed of ShadowClan. He’d 
been among them, but watching unseen, 
like a spirit from StarClan. They weren’t 
aware that he was there. He wasn’t even 
sure these dream cats would have known 
him, for they seemed to inhabit a reality 
he barely recognized. 

The pines around the camp had 
seemed so thick they hid the sky. 
Darktail had stalked the clearing, and, 
hollow-eyed, his Clanmates had 
followed his orders to defend the border 
from a predatory SkyClan. Tigerheart 


had tracked them to the scent line and 
watched in horror as they battled 
desperately while SkyClan drove them 
back. Ivypool fought alongside SkyClan, 
her eyes shining with spiteful triumph as 
ShadowClan cats fell one by one. 
Scorchfur lay shrieking in agony, blood 
oozing from his flanks. Whorlpaw 
wailed over Snakepaw’s battered body. 
Flowerpaw backed away as Hawkwing 
snarled at her, lips drawn back. 
Snowbird dropped to her belly as 
Leafstar’s claws left red trails across the 
white warrior’s face. And all the while 
Darktail had slipped among the 
shadows, urging them to fight, driving 
ShadowClan to more suffering—never 


entering the battle, but always goading 
them to sacrifice more. 

Tigerheart’s fur rippled as he pushed 
himself to his paws and blinked in the 
watery dawn light. The nest where he’d 
slept was hardly more than a pile of 
leaves, gathered in a drift against a 
fallen tree. He’d been traveling for days, 
following the Silverpath by day, hunting 
and sleeping by night. His paws ached 
from walking, and he felt colder each 
day. He’d grown almost numb to the roar 
and the wind of passing Thundersnakes 
and more than once had eaten prey one 
of them had killed. Or at least he 
guessed the Thundersnake had killed it, 
because he’d found it lying beside the 


track, sour with death. For the first time 
in his life he had tasted deer flesh. It was 
stale, not far from rotting, but he’d eaten 
it gratefully. He was ashamed to eat 
crow-food, but eating what the 
Thundersnake left gave him more time to 
travel. 

Twoleg nests had grown more 
numerous in the past day. He’d slept 
farther from the track last night, away 
from the dens clustering around the 
Silverpath. He guessed he would reach 
another stopping place soon, where 
Twolegs could bustle in and out of the 
Thundersnake. He glanced around the 
small copse where he’d spent the night 
and tasted the air. He’d hunted and eaten 


before he slept, but he was hungry again. 
There were no fresh prey-scents left 
here. He would have to hunt as he 
walked. 

As he padded from the shadow of the 
trees into a thin drizzle, last mght’s 
dream haunted him. Guilt wormed in his 
belly. Had he left ShadowClan 
unprotected? StarClan, take care of 
them. He fluffed out his pelt against the 
rain and focused on Dovewing. She 
needed him. His decision to leave had 
been right. Hadn’t Puddleshine seen his 
shadow block the sun? 

He pushed his way through the wet 
grass and slid between two dens, 
emerging onto the Silverpath beyond. A 


puddle gleamed where water pooled 
between the tracks. Thirsty, Tigerheart 
stopped beside it and drank. He 
shuddered at the foul taste and padded 
on, feeling queasy and longing for the 
fresh rainwater pools of the forest. 

The rain was hardening, and the 
damp reached through his fur as he 
followed the Silverpath down a gentle 
slope, where the cluster of Twoleg nests 
thickened. He could smell Thunderpaths 
and hear the rumbling of monsters 
beyond them. The track reached deeper 
into the earth, the land rising on either 
side in steep banks until Tigerheart’s 
paws began to prick nervously. Twoleg 
fences walled the top of the banks. He 


was hemmed in now, like prey in a 
gorge. Ahead, a Thunderpath spanned 
the track, arching above it. Tigerheart 
glanced nervously over his shoulder. 
Don t let a Thundersnake come now. He 
quickened his pace, hoping that the 
Silverpath would lead into countryside 
once more. 

Ahead, a flat stone ledge sat 
squarely beside the track. Another 
stopping place for a Thundersnake. It 
was slick with rain. Tigerheart scanned 
the ledge nervously, relieved when he 
saw no Twolegs waiting there. As he 
hurried past it, a mouse darted across the 
track. He pricked his ears. His belly was 
still hollow, so he dropped into a hunting 


crouch and watched the mouse scamper 
over the track and scrabble up the steep 
slope onto the stone ledge. Eyeing it 
hungrily, Tigerheart wondered whether 
to follow. The ledge was deserted. It 
would be easy enough to jump up, catch 
the mouse, and carry it to eat in a quiet 
spot beyond the Thundersnake’s resting 
place. He was hungry enough to risk it. 
The mouse scurried across the wide 
stretch of stone. Tigerheart leaped onto 
the ledge. He tracked it, his pads 
slapping softly against the wet stone. 
The mouse hurried for shelter where the 
ledge met a wall, and ran along the edge. 
Heart quickening, Tigerheart broke into 
a run, racing after the mouse. He leaped 


and caught it between his front paws. He 
hooked it up and snapped its spine in his 
jaws. The sweet odor of fresh prey 
flooded his mouth. 

Suddenly, something clacked on the 
stone behind him. He turned to see a 
Twoleg walk onto the ledge. Another 
followed, then a third. Panic shrilled 
through his body as one turned and 
stared at him, its eyes widening in 
surprise. 

Without thinking, Tigerheart raced 
for a pile of Twoleg shells. They were 
heaped on wooden slats, piled as high as 
the bramble walls of the ShadowClan 
camp. Gaps opened between them, large 
enough to squeeze between but small 


enough to hide in. He nosed his way 
inside the pile, the mouse still in his 
jaws. Wriggling deep, he caught his 
breath. The sound of Twoleg paw steps 
grew. Peering out between two shells, 
Tigerheart could see the ledge growing 
busy with more Twolegs. A 
Thundersnake must be coming. Once the 
creature had passed, the Twolegs would 
leave, and the ledge would be empty 
once more. All he had to do was wait. 
He drew back as one of the Twolegs 
walked toward the pile of clutter. A 
heavy shell dangled from its paw. With a 
grunt, the Twoleg heaved it on top of the 
pile and walked away. The shells around 
Tigerheart shifted slightly, then settled 


again. Tigerheart drew back into the 
shadows and began to eat his mouse. No 
one could see him here, so he might as 
well satisfy the hunger growling in his 
belly. 

As he swallowed the last morsel, he 
heard a Thundersnake rumbling to a stop 
at the ledge. Good. The Twolegs would 
be gone soon, and he could start 
traveling again. He settled in deeper 
among the shells. 

Then, with a lurch, the pile of shells 
began to trundle toward the 
Thundersnake. J’m moving. Shock 
spiked through Tigerheart’s pelt as he 
felt the pile roll across the ledge, the 
Shells rocking around him. 


He tried to get out, but a shell was 
squashing his tail. As the pile of shells 
rolled into the gloom of the 
Thundersnake’s belly, he tugged it free 
and scrambled from the pile. His pelt 
bushed as he saw the gap in the 
Thundersnake’s side sliding shut. The 
bright air outside narrowed to a slit and, 
by the time he’d reached it, disappeared. 

He pawed at the curious wall, as if 
his small claws could cut a hole through 
which he could pass. But it was useless. 

I’m trapped inside the 
Thundersnake! 


As darkness closed around him, 
Tigerheart tasted the air. It was rank and 
musty, the scent of Twolegs faint and 


stale. He peered out from the pile of 
shapes. Other piles and larger shells 
were strapped to the walls and fastened 
to the floor. Tigerheart felt a prickle of 
relief. This must be the part of the 
Thundersnake where Twolegs stored 
their clutter. He tried to steady his 
breathing. At least he wasn’t trapped 
with Twolegs. 

As the Thundersnake rumbled 
beneath his paws, he crept out and 
picked his way around the clutter, 
searching for a way out. Light seeped in 
through a gap high up in the wall. 
Quickly he scrambled up a cold, hard 
branch and crept cautiously along it until 
he could peer out of the Thundersnake. 


He saw Twoleg nests flashing past, 
taller than any he had seen before. From 
here he couldn’t see their tops, but as the 
Thundersnake raced on, they began to 
grow wider, their stone walls darker. 
Suddenly the Thundersnake plunged into 
darkness. Light flickered inside its belly, 
but beyond the clear walls, blackness 
pressed against its flanks as the 
Thundersnake rumbled deeper into 
darkness. /t's just a tunnel, Tigerheart 
told himself as his claws scraped against 
the hard surface. The Thundersnake 
began to slow. Tigerheart looked for 
daylight beyond the clear walls, where 
the darkness was easing. But there was 
no sign of sky, or of daylight. A harsh 


yellow glow lit a stone cave outside as 
the Thundersnake slid to a halt. /ts 
brought me to its lair. I feel like a piece 
of prey! 

Tigerheart pressed harder against the 
floor, terror swamping him as the gaps in 
the flanks opened and the Twolegs began 
to stream out. 

He froze. What do I do? Surely it 
was crazy to step into a Thundersnake’s 
den? Through the gap he saw another 
Thundersnake. It sat a tree-length away, 
at the other side of the ledge, humming 
while Twolegs crowded past it. This 
was a Thundersnake camp! 

Dread crawled through his fur. 
Tigerheart stared at the Thundersnake 


camp, willing himself to move. If he 
didn’t, he might never find Dovewing. / 
have to be brave, he told himself: 

Then he pelted through the gap in the 
Thundersnake’s flank, out into its 
heaving nest. 





CHAPTER 13 
Cog 


Tigerheart fled along the ledge between 
two Thundersnakes. The stone was 
slippery beneath his paws; his claws 
slithered over it, unable to get a grip as 
he dodged back and forth, swerving 
around Twolegs. They yelped as he shot 
past them. He wanted to get away from 
the snakes, away from the Twolegs, but 
the great cavern seemed to stretch away 
in every direction. He saw tunnels 
opening at its edges, but the dazzling 
light almost blinded him, and he couldn’ t 
see where they led. Twoleg voices 
echoed from the walls and the high, 


domed roof. Clanking and rumbling 
made the air tremble. Countless scents 
overwhelmed his senses. 

Heart bursting with terror, he cleared 
the snakes and glanced back, shocked to 
see yet more Thundersnakes flanking 
them. Twolegs hurried to and from them, 
disappearing into one, pouring out from 
another. 

Instinctively, Tigerheart headed for a 
wall. Like prey, he craved shelter. He 
ran for the nearest one and crouched in 
its shadow, scuttling backward until he’d 
edged himself into a corner where two 
walls met. The Twolegs ignored him. 
Though they’d yelped as he’d passed 
them, none seemed interested in 


following him. He huddled in the shade 
of the walls and stared. 

The cavern was huge. Brightly lit 
dens in the walls thronged with Twolegs. 
Arches and tunnels showed between 
them. Steadying his breath, Tigerheart let 
his panic ease and tried to think. If he 
could get used to the acrid stench of 
Thundersnakes and Twolegs, he might be 
able to detect fresh air. He slowed his 
breathing and narrowed his eyes. 
Opening his mouth, he let the jumble of 
scents bathe his tongue. At first it was 
overwhelming and he felt sick, but 
gradually he grew accustomed to the 
strange smells, just as his ears adjusted 
to the unending cacophony. 


A few scents smelled tasty, others 
were sour, and some were bitter or 
rancid, but none tasted of fresh air. He 
would have to creep out of his hiding 
place and explore one tunnel at a time. 
Surely one must lead up into daylight? 

Keeping low, he slipped along the 
wall to the front of a brightly lit den. A 
Twoleg padded out and headed across 
the cavern. Tigerheart hurried across the 
entrance and ducked around the far wall. 
A tunnel, lit by harsh light, opened ahead 
of him. He opened his jaws, hoping to 
taste fresh air that would guide him out, 
but only harsh scents landed on his 
tongue. It leads away from the cavern, 
though. Perhaps it would join another 


tunnel that would take him out of this 
warren. 

The slick stone floor was cold 
beneath his paws, and he hurried, 
relieved that no Twolegs were using the 
tunnel. It opened quickly into another 
cavern, smaller and without 
Thundersnakes, but edged by more 
brightly lit dens. He scurried past each 
one, ignoring the surprised barks of 
Twolegs as he dodged around them. 
Mouth open, he tasted the air for the way 
out. He scanned the high walls, hoping to 
see a clear stretch that would show him 
the sky. But the walls were covered in 
strange images and shapes that gave no 
clue as to how he might get outside. 


Suddenly a scent touched his tongue 
that made him freeze. 

Cat. 

Another cat was here! He smelled 
tom scent with a rush of surprise that 
made him scan the cavern more closely. 
The scent was both fresh and old, as 
though a cat visited this place regularly. 
Did a cat live here? 

Accustomed now to the idea that the 
Twolegs here wouldn’t chase him, and 
that he only had to avoid their clumsy 
paws, he paused beside the opening of a 
brightly lit den and took a moment to 
analyze the tom’s scent. It was stale 
here, but fresher beyond the den 
entrance. He headed toward the fresher 


scent, pleased to find it so strong that he 
knew the tom must have passed this way 
very recently. 

Tracking the smell, he wove through 
the stone columns that stood like trees 
around the cavern. The trail led him 
toward a small opening in the lower part 
of a wall. A hard mesh lay in front of it, 
as though it had fallen away from the 
opening. Tigerheart ducked inside, 
relieved to find it dark here, and the 
scent of the tom much stronger. 

A hiss from the shadows made him 
freeze. 

“Pm Tigerheart,” he mewed quickly. 
“Tm not here to fight. I just need some 
help.” He unsheathed his claws warily. 


This tom might not want to welcome a 
new cat onto his territory. As his eyes 
adjusted to the gloom, he saw a skinny 
black-and-white cat glaring at him 
through slitted eyes. 

Back arched, the tom showed its 
teeth. “Get out or [Tl shred your 
muzzle.” 

Tigerheart backed away. “Please,” 
he begged. “I just need to find my way 
out of this place.” He tried not to 
wrinkle his nose. The tom smelled like 
Twoleg leavings. 

His gaze flitted over Tigerheart. 
Slowly his arched back relaxed. “You’re 
not here to steal food?” 

“I don’t need to steal food,” 


Tigerheart told him. “I can hunt.” 

“You don’t want to fight?” The tom 
sounded suspicious. 

“No.” He waited while the tom 
breathed deeply, clearly testing his 
scent. 

“You don’t smell like a rot pile cat,” 
he conceded. 

“What’s a rot pile cat?” Tigerheart 
wondered if there were different Clans 
here too. 

“There’s a gang of cats that hangs 
around the rot pile behind the station,” 
the tom explained. “They’re always 
trying to drive me away. I don’t know 
why. The Twolegs here leave enough 
trash for every cat.” 


Rot pile? Station? Trash? This cat 
used odd words. He stared at the tom, 
suddenly aware how far from home he 
was. He didn’t even understand the 
language. His pelt prickled nervously. 
He puffed out his chest. “Why don’t you 
fight them?” 

“There are three of them.” The tom 
looked at him like he was a mouse- 
brain. “There’s only one of me.” 

“Don’t you have Clanmates here?” 

“Clanmates?” The tom stared at him, 
puzzled. 

Tigerheart groped for a word this cat 
could understand. “Kin.” 

“T'm the only cat in the station.” 

“Is that what this place is called?” 


Tigerheart pricked his ears. “I thought it 
was a Thundersnake nest.” 

The tom blinked at him. “You’re not 
from the city at all, are you? Only 
outsiders call trains Thundersnakes.” 

City? Tigerheart blinked back. “I’m 
from the forest. Pm looking for my 
friend.” 

“Is your friend from the forest too?” 

“Yes.” 

The tom tipped his head. “I didn’t 
know there were strays in the forest.” 

“We're not strays,” Tigerheart 
corrected him. “We’re warriors.” 

For the first time the tom looked 
interested. His gaze sharpened, glittering 
in the dingy light seeping into the den. 


“A warrior? Does that mean you fight?” 

Tigerheart didn’t like the inquisitive 
edge in the tom’s mew. “I can fight if I 
have to,” he mewed cagily. What does 
he want? 

The tom dipped his head. “I’m Dash, 
by the way. I live here.” 

“T guessed.” Tigerheart wasn’t ready 
to warm to this prickly cat. He seemed 
to be planning something. 

“So?” Dash leaned closer. “Do you 
know where your friend was heading?” 

Tigerheart avoided answering 
Dash’s question directly. “Is there a big 
Twoleg den here with a roof that has 
gorse spines sticking up to the sky?” 

Dash frowned. “Gorse spines?” 


“Like this.” Tigerheart held up a paw 
and fanned out his claws. 

Dash tipped his head. ““There’s a big 
den with a couple small thorns, and one 
big thorn. It’s a Twoleg gathering place.” 

A Twoleg gathering place! That’s 
what Ajax had called it! Could it be the 
gorse-spined den Dovewing had 
dreamed about? He had to check. “Is it 
near here?” 

“Tt’s not far.” 

“Can you show me?” 

Dash looked down at his paws. “I 
can help you—if you help me.” 

“You need help?” Tigerheart’s eyes 
narrowed. Dash sounded cagey. Was he 
going to ask Tigerheart to do something 


bad? 

“I told you,” Dash meowed. “The rot 
pile cats have been trying to drive me 
away. If they thought I had a tough friend, 
they might leave me alone.” 

“You want me to help fight them.” 
Why hadn’t he just asked straight out? 

Dash looked away. “I’m not so good 
at fighting.” 

“Of course you are. You’re a cat.” 

“So are they,” Dash pointed out. 

Tigerheart felt a glimmer of pity for 
the tom. No cat liked to be bullied. “Do 
they belong to a Clan?” He wanted to 
know what fighting skills they had. 

“Clan?” Dash looked confused. “We 
don’t have Clans in the city. They’re just 


strays.” 

Strays. Hopefully they wouldn’t 
know any warrior moves. Tigerheart 
jerked his nose toward the entrance to 
Dash’s den. “Can you show me where 
they are?” 

“They ll be around the rot piles.” 
Dash padded past him and slipped out 
into the cavern. 

Tigerheart followed, relieved to 
have a guide this time. He trailed Dash 
as the station cat skirted a long wall, 
then turned to climb a tunnel that sloped 
upward. Twolegs streamed past them, 
unheeding, as the tunnel divided and then 
turned sharply. Tigerheart was met by 
fresher scents, and his fur prickled with 


excitement, even though they were 
slightly tainted by monster stench. 
Dovewing might be out there—she might 
be nearby. And if he could deal with 
these rot pile cats, Dash would take him 
to look for her. 

He quickened his pace as Dash 
turned in to a narrower tunnel where 
there were no Twolegs. 

Dash hurried along it. A wall 
blocked the end, but Dash nodded 
toward a piece of mesh, like the one 
lying outside his den. “The way out is 
through this vent.” The mesh hung 
loosely over a small opening; Dash 
nosed it open easily and slid through. 
Tigerheart followed the station cat into a 


small dark tunnel. A cold breeze 
funneled over him as he glimpsed light at 
the end. It wasn’t the harsh yellow of the 
station, but cool, bright daylight. 

Relief swamped Tigerheart, and the 
panic that had been sparking at the edges 
of his thoughts since he found himself in 
the belly of the Thundersnake began to 
ease. He breathed deeply as he squeezed 
past another vent into the open air. 

Once outside, Tigerheart 
immediately smelled crow-food. The 
sour stink bathed his muzzle. Dash was 
gazing toward a stretch of ground where 
four huge red shapes—like square 
monsters—stood, overflowing with 
stinking Twoleg waste. 


“Those are the ‘rot piles’?” 
Tigerheart guessed. He drew back into 
the shadow of the station wall. 

“Yes.” Dash crouched beside him. 
From their hiding place, Tigerheart 
could see two mangy toms sniffing 
around the base of one of the rot piles 
while a big brown tabby she-cat dug 
through the litter at the top. 

“That’s them,” Dash whispered. 

“Which one is the meanest?” 
Tigerheart asked. 

“Floyd.” Dash nodded toward the 
smaller of the toms. He was brown and 
white, his muzzle filthy and his ear tips 
torn from fighting. 

“Okay.” Tigerheart assessed the 


three cats quickly. “You’re going to have 
to help—” 

“But I can’t fight,” Dash protested in 
a whisper. 

“You only need one move.” He 
turned on Dash and slowly but firmly 
swept one paw under the station cat’s 
front paws, tugging them from beneath 
him, then swept another softly over his 
ears. 

Dash stumbled, but Tigerheart caught 
him before his flank hit the ground. 

“You try it on me,” Tigerheart 
ordered. 

Dash blinked at him, recovering 
from his surprise, then frowned 
thoughtfully. After a moment of 


concentration, he jabbed clumsily at 
Tigerheart’s front paws, managing to 
hook them with speed rather than 
accuracy, and then swung an awkward 
blow that caught one of Tigerheart’s 
ears. 

“Not bad.” Tigerheart stumbled and 
regained his balance. “Ill drive the she- 
cat from the top of the rot pile. As soon 
as she lands, you do your move on 
Floyd.” 

“On Floyd?” Dash looked alarmed. 
“But what if he fights back?” 

“Don’t worry. You just need to start 
the fight. Pll finish it,’ Tigerheart 
promised. “But it has to look like you 
attacked them, or they’ll keep hassling 


99 


you. 

Dash nodded. 

“Remember,” Tigerheart encouraged, 
“you're fighting for your territory, 
okay?” 

Dash’s eyes flashed anxiously. 
Tigerheart didn’t give him a chance to 
argue. “Follow me.” He marched across 
the stone and leaped onto the rot pile 
where the tabby was rummaging. His 
paws sank right into the garbage. He 
swallowed against the nausea that swept 
over him as he felt wetness seep into his 
fur. 

The tabby looked at him in surprise. 
Her warm scent touched his nose. “Hi.” 
She flicked her tail at him flirtatiously. 


““You’re new around here.” 

A hiss sounded from below. “Mae! 
Who are you talking to?” 

Mae picked her way across the 
stinking rubbish and peered over the 
edge. “Just a stranger.” She glanced back 
at Tigerheart and winked. “It’s nice to 
see a tom who looks like he can feed 
himself.” 

Tigerheart glanced at Dash, who was 
padding across the stone toward the two 
toms. “I’ve moved into the station with 
Dash,” he meowed quickly. “And we 
don’t think there’s enough food around 
here to share with you three.” He 
flattened his ears and gave her a warning 
hiss. 


Her gaze hardened instantly. “Do you 
really think you and that fleabag can 
drive us away?” She curled her lip. 
“We’re the ones who own these bins. 
The sooner you learn that, the better.” 
With a hiss, she flung herself at him. He 
leaped clear, the garbage shifting 
beneath his paws. This wasn’t an easy 
place to fight. As he turned to meet 
another attack, his paws sunk deeper. 
Below, he heard an angry yowl. 

“You think you can fight now, station 
cat?” 

Struggling to get a paw hold, 
Tigerheart reared to meet Mae’s attack. 
He wrapped his paws around her and, 
holding on hard, threw himself onto his 


side and rolled over the trash toward the 
edge of the rot pile. Then he dropped 
over the edge, dragging her with him. As 
his paws met the stone, he let his hind 
legs fold beneath him, absorbing the 
impact of the landing while he still held 
Mae. 

She struggled and hissed in his grip. 
Behind him he heard an angry yowl. He 
glanced backward and saw Floyd 
collapse onto the stone as Dash swung a 
blow at his cheek. Well done! He flung 
Mae away and leaped between Dash and 
Floyd while the ragged tom found his 
paws. 

“Hi,” Tigerheart snarled. “I’m 
Dash’s new friend.” He sliced his claws 


across the mangy tom’s face. 

He heard the tabby hiss behind him 
and kicked out his hind legs. His paws 
slammed into her chest. She grunted and 
staggered away. 

The other tom stared, unmoving, 
from beside the rot pile. Floyd backed 
away, hissing. Tigerheart padded to 
Dash’s side as Mae glared angrily at 
Floyd, her pelt ruffled. 

“Is that it?” she growled at the 
brown-and-white tom. “Aren’t you going 
to fight him?” 

“You fight him,” Floyd spat back. 
“His claws are sharp.” He dabbed at his 
bloody muzzle with a paw. 

“He threw me off the rot pile!” Mae 


snapped indignantly. She looked at the 
other tom. “What about you, Scrap? 
Aren’t you going to defend me?” 

Scrap looked nervously from 
Tigerheart to Dash. “Why don’t we just 
go and find somewhere else to eat?” he 
mewed. “There are some more rot piles 
just down the street.” 

Tigerheart showed his teeth. “Good 
idea.” These cats were mouse-hearts. 
“Go scavenge somewhere else. This is 
Dash’s territory.” 

The rot pile cats glanced at one 
another  uncertainly. Then Floyd 
shrugged. “I guess we could find other 
rot piles. There’s no decent food here 
anyway.” He turned and headed down 


the stone path that led toward a gap 
where monsters rumbled past. Scrap 
followed him, glancing reproachfully at 
Dash. Mae shot Tigerheart a look. “You 
didn’t have to get mean.” 

“You've been bullying Dash.” 
Tigerheart glared at her. 

“Its his own fault for being so 
pathetic.” She hissed at Dash and headed 
after the others. 

“At least he’s willing to fight for 
what’s his!” Tigerheart yowled after her. 

“Yeah!” Dash fluffed out his fur. “So 
don’t come back here.” 

Tigerheart glanced at him. “Are you 
going to be okay once I’m gone?” 

“Sure.” Dash blinked at him happily. 


“Now that Pve seen how easily they 
give up.” 

“If they ever learn how to work 
together, they might be dangerous,” 
Tigerheart warned. 

“They won't.” Dash watched them as 
they disappeared around the corner. 
“Cats tend to look out for themselves 
around here.” 

“They look out for one another 
where I come from,” Tigerheart told 
him, trying to ignore the prickles of 
sadness in his chest as he thought about 
how much fun it was, hunting with his 
Clanmates. 

“Why?” 

Tigerheart stared at him. Couldn’t he 


guess? “Cats are stronger when they 
work together.” 

“But isn’t it easier when you only 
have to take care of yourself?” Dash 
seemed perplexed. 

The tom’s words sparked guilt in 
Tigerheart’s belly. Wasn’t that the 
thought he’d had when he left 
ShadowClan? No! I’m going to find 
Dovewing. She needs me. He blinked at 
Dash. “You didn’t seem to be doing so 
well at taking care of yourself.” 

“I made you help me.” Dash swished 
his tail. “That was pretty smart.” 

“You didn’t make me do anything,” 
Tigerheart told him. “I wanted to help 


99 


you. 


“Really?” Dash looked surprised. 

“Really.” Tigerheart glanced along 
the stone path that the rot pile cats had 
taken toward the Thunderpath. “Is the 
Twoleg gathering place that way?” 

Dash followed his gaze. “Yes.” He 
glanced hungrily at the rot pile. “Do you 
want some food first?” 

Tigerheart still had the scent of 
rancid trash on his paws. “No, thanks. 
Pll hunt later.” He craned his neck, 
looking up at the dens towering around 
him. It was like being in a forest, with 
slivers of sky cutting between the 
soaring rooftops. The sun was sliding 
slowly behind them. 

Dash was still looking at the rot 


piles. “Come on, let’s rummage for food. 
You'll like it. Some of it’s really good.” 

“No, thanks.” Tigerheart wished 
Dash would stop offering. He wanted to 
find out if the gathering place was the 
thorn den Dovewing had been looking 
for. “I don’t eat crow-food unless I have 
no choice.” 

“Crow-food?” Dash frowned. 

“Scraps,” Tigerheart explained. 

“Crow-food.” Dash repeated 
thoughtfully. He was quiet for a moment, 
as though thinking; then he shrugged. “I 
guess if it’s good enough for a crow, it’s 
good enough for me.” 

Tigerheart’s pelt pricked uneasily. 
Why did Dovewing believe it was better 


to raise their kits in a place where cats 
thought of themselves as no better than 
crows? “Come on.” He headed along the 
stone path, flattening his ears against the 
rumbling of the monsters at the end. 
Dash fell in beside him as they 
reached a monster sleeping beside a 
wall. It had lost one of its paws, and its 
pelt was dull. Tigerheart wondered if it 
was dead. Dash padded past it, 
unconcerned, and Tigerheart followed. 
At the end of the path, wind whisked 
around the corner. It stung his eyes so 
that the monsters and Twolegs, streaming 
past, blurred in front of him. Tigerheart 
hesitated, fear sparking beneath his pelt 
as Dash padded onto the stone walkway 


that edged the Thunderpath. 

“Come on.” The station cat beckoned 
Tigerheart with his tail. 

Tigerheart forced himself out into the 
flood of movement. A stinking breeze 
washed his pelt. The glittering walls and 
towering dens made him dizzy. Roofs cut 
a jagged line through the sky. He dodged 
a Twoleg and pressed against a wall. 
“Why do the Twolegs here need such big 
dens?” he asked, trying to distract 
himself from the panic welling in his 
chest. 

“There are a lot of Twolegs in the 
city.” Dash ducked beside him as 
Twolegs streamed past them. “I guess 
they’ ve all got to sleep somewhere.” 


Tigerheart blinked at the station cat. 
How did he stay so calm? Beyond the 
Twolegs, monsters were crawling along 
the road in an endless stream, honking at 
one another like geese. He was glad 
Ajax and Fuzzball had shown him how 
to slip around Twolegs and monsters in 
their small Twolegplace. That had 
seemed busy. This was overwhelming. 
He stared at Dash with wide eyes. “How 
do you get around here? It’s so 
crowded!” 

Dash shrugged. “Everything keeps 
moving, but not very fast, and the 
Twolegs and monsters aren’t interested 
in cats. Just keep your head down and 
don’t get in anything’s way and you'll be 


fine. Follow me.” He skirted the wall, 
following the stone walkway until a 
Thunderpath crossed it. 

“Where now?” Tigerheart stared at 
the gap between the dens where two 
Thunderpaths crossed. Lights flashed on 
sticks, red and green, above their heads. 

“Wait until that light shows green.” 
Dash nodded to a light shaped like a 
Twoleg. “Then we cross _ the 
Thunderpath with the Twolegs. Just 
don’t trip them. That makes them mad.” 

Tigerheart stared at the green light as 
it suddenly brightened. The monsters 
stopped as though an invisible wall had 
dropped in front of them, and the 
Twolegs streamed over the Thunderpath. 


“Now!” Dash nudged Tigerheart 
forward with his shoulder. 

Tigerheart hurried beside him. His 
heart pounded with terror. He focused on 
the Thunderpath, smooth beneath his 
paws, and forced himself not to break 
into a run. Twolegs flowed around them, 
and he didn’t want to risk tripping them. 
Relief washed over him as he reached 
the walkway on the other side. Dash 
guided him forward along another stone 
walkway that lined an even wider 
Thunderpath. 

Tigerheart kept his eyes fixed ahead. 
The noise and bustle around him made 
his head swim. How had Dovewing 
found her way through these noisy 


crowded trails? “Is the gathering place 
far?” 

“Just a little farther.” Dash picked up 
his pace as the crowd of Twolegs began 
to thin. He turned a corner onto a quieter 
walkway, narrower and with fewer 
Twolegs and monsters teeming between 
the dens. 

They crossed more Thunderpaths, 
each a little quieter than the last, until 
finally Tigerheart saw a break in the 
dens and a stretch of green ahead. His 
heart soared at the sight of grass and 
trees. In the center sat a den, squat 
compared to the towering dens that 
surrounded it. Its stone walls were 
punctuated by stretches of colored stone 


that reflected the late afternoon light like 
shattered rainbows. A sloping roof 
stretched along the den like a bony 
spine. On either side, small spikes 
poked into the sky, and in the middle, 
one huge spike looked as though it were 
trying to spear the clouds. “The gorse 
thorns!” Tigerheart stopped and stared. 
Was this the den Dovewing had dreamed 
of? Surely it must be. He’d followed the 
Silverpath and here it was. 

Dash stopped. “You can find your 
own way from here.” He dipped his 
head to Tigerheart. “Thanks for chasing 
Floyd and the others away. P11 be able 
to sleep easier for a while.” 

Tigerheart dragged his gaze from the 


thorn den. “If they come back, don’t 
forget the fighting move I taught you.” 

“I won't.” Dash blinked at him 
happily. “Good luck. I hope you find 
your friend.” 

“So do I.” 

As Dash turned back along the 
pathway, Tigerheart stared at the 
gathering place. It seemed empty. The 
stretch of grass surrounding it was 
deserted. Thin slabs of stone stood 
upright in neat rows. Tigerheart hurried 
forward and, relieved to feel grass 
underpaw once again, wove between 
them. He tasted the air, hoping to catch 
Dovewing’s scent. His heart tightened as 
he scanned the great, glittering den. /’m 


here... . I just hope that Dovewing is 
here too. 





CHAPTER 14 
Cog 


The thin stone slabs cast long shadows 
as the sun slid behind the huge dens. 
Tigerheart shook out his fur. The 
rumbling of monsters was quieter here. 
This patch of green seemed sheltered 
from the noise and movement of the 
heaving city by the trees growing among 
the slabs. Their branches crisscrossed 
the sky, rattling softly in a breeze that 
carried reminders of forest scents among 
the Twoleg stench. Tigerheart 
remembered with a pang the secluded 
glade where he and Dovewing had met 
in secret. Would she forgive him for not 


meeting her there before she left? He 
tasted the air anxiously, hoping to catch a 
scent that would lead him to her. 

“Who are you?” A growl sounded on 
the evening air. 

Tigerheart unsheathed his claws 
defensively and scanned the stones. 

Green eyes glared through the fading 
light. A tortoiseshell she-cat faced him, 
her black muzzle thrust forward. Two 
toms flanked her, one small but well- 
muscled with a brown-and-black 
splotched pelt, the other smoky gray and 
long-furred. 

The three cats padded slowly toward 
him, flattening their ears aggressively as 
they neared. 


“Pm looking for someone,” 
Tigerheart told them quickly. His heart 
lurched as he wondered if Dovewing 
had met these cats. They didn’t seem 
welcoming. What if they'd chased her 
off? Or hurt her? 

The toms halted as the tortoiseshell 
flicked her tail. She padded closer to 
Tigerheart, showing her teeth. “Who are 
you?” she repeated slowly. 

“My name’s Tigerheart.” He glanced 
at the gathering place behind the 
tortoiseshell. The sun had dropped 
behind the skyline and swept it into 
shadow. Without its glittering walls and 
glinting roof, it looked gloomy and 
forbidding. “My friend traveled a long 


way to find this place. And I’ve traveled 
a long way to find her.” 

Curiosity glittered in the 
tortoiseshell’s gaze. “You’re looking for 
a She-cat?” 

““She’s my mate.” Tigerheart felt his 
throat tighten. Saying the words opened 
grief in his chest that he’d ignored for so 
long. He’d forgotten how much he 
missed Dovewing. “She’s carrying my 
kits.” 

The tortoiseshell tipped her head. 
Her ears pricked. Her gaze lost its 
menace. “What’s her name?” 

“Dovewing.” Tigerheart’s mew was 
thick with emotion. He felt suddenly 
weary. 


She glanced over her shoulder at the 
brown-and-black tom. “Ant. Go and see 
if there’s a cat with that name here.” 

As he hurried away, she snapped her 
gaze back to Tigerheart. 

Tigerheart blinked at the 
tortoiseshell hopefully as Ant 
disappeared into the shadows around the 
gathering place. 

“My name’s Fierce,” she told him. 
She nodded toward the gray tom. “That’s 
Cobweb.” 

“Do you live here?” 

Fierce eyed him distrustfully. “How 
long have you been traveling?” 

“Days.” 

“You must be tired.” 


Tigerheart lifted his chin, ignoring 
the weariness dragging at his bones. 
“Not too tired to keep traveling if I have 
to. I need to find Dovewing.” Perhaps if 
he kept pressing, she’d tell him if 
Dovewing had been here. 

Fierce didn’t reply, but stared at him 
in silence. 

Tigerheart stared back, desperately 
trying to read her green gaze. Was she 
hiding something? He saw nothing but 
the reflection of harsh Twoleg lights, 
which were beginning to glimmer behind 
him. 

Cobweb shifted restlessly as the 
twilight deepened. At last, Tigerheart 
saw movement in the shadows. Ant was 


hurrying between the stone slabs. He 
stopped beside Fierce and whispered in 
her ear. 

Tigerheart held his breath. Was 
Dovewing here? 

“She says she’ll see you,” Fierce 
meowed curtly. “Follow me.” 

Joy burst in Tigerheart’s chest. 
“She’s here?” He could hardly believe 
it. 

Fierce turned away and padded 
toward the gathering place. Tigerheart’s 
paws trembled with excitement as he 
followed. He’d found her! Dovewing 
was here! Ant and Cobweb fell in 
behind him as he wove between the 
slabs. Fierce led him to an opening in 


the ground where stone steps led down 
to a stretch of clear wall. The stones 
beside the clear wall had been 
dislodged so that a gap opened beside it. 
Fierce slid through it and Tigerheart 
followed. He emerged onto a ledge that 
looked down into a large square cave. 
He scanned it nervously. “Do Twolegs 
come here?” 

“Not anymore.” Fierce paused on the 
ledge. 

Smooth walls lined the cavern. 
Twolegs must have carved it out. It was 
lit by stretches of transparent stone set 
high in the walls, which let evening light 
filter through. Twoleg clutter sat in piles 
against the walls here and there. He 


couldn’t believe that Dovewing, a 
warrior, would ever have chosen to 
make a home here. How convinced was 
she that her dreams were a bad omen 
for our kits? he wondered. 

He saw a cat move among the 
shadows. Another crossed the wide, 
shiny floor. 

“Where’s Dovewing?” He pushed 
past Fierce. 

“Wait.” She nudged him out of the 
way and hopped down onto a wooden 
ledge below and then onto the floor. 

He stared at her as Cobweb and Ant 
brushed past him and followed her 
down. 

I cant wait any longer! 


“Dovewing!” His mew echoed through 
the shadowy space. 

“Hush!” Fierce shot him a warning 
look. “There are sick cats here. They 
don’t need you making a racket.” She 
beckoned him with a sharp flick of her 
tail, and he jumped down onto the 
wooden ledge she’d used. It wobbled 
beneath his paws, and he dropped 
quickly to the floor, which felt cool and 
smooth, tainted by a sharp Twoleg tang. 
As he followed Fierce, the floor felt 
tacky, and it peeled stickily away from 
his pads with each step. 

Cobweb and Ant flanked him, 
moving noiselessly over the floor. 

Tigerheart smelled sickness as they 


passed a nest made of furless pelts. A 
one-eyed tabby leaned into it and lapped 
the dull fur of a stinking she-cat who lay 
there limply. Another cat carried a wad 
of something soft toward a hollow stick 
that jutted from the wall and dripped 
water onto the floor. She placed the wad 
beneath the drip and stood back while it 
soaked up the moisture. Fierce followed 
his gaze. “She’s collecting water for cats 
too sick to walk to the drip-pipe.” 

“Is that where you drink?” Tigerheart 
stared at the stinking patch of damp 
spreading around it. 

“Cats who aren’t sick drink outside. 
The drip-pipe provides water for the 
rest,” Fierce explained matter-of-factly. 


Another nest caught Tigerheart’s 
gaze, where a cat lapped the paw of 
another. It was hard to see in the 
shadows, but he smelled blood and 
herbs. “Is that a medicine cat?” 

“A what?” Fierce looked at him. 

“A cat who takes care of sick cats.” 

Cobweb followed his gaze. “That’s 
Bracken. He’s treating Rascal’s rat 
bite.” 

“We all take care of sick cats here,” 
Ant explained. 

Tigerheart noticed that old wounds 
scarred Ant’s cheek. Cobweb had half 
an ear missing, and Fierce leaned as she 
stood—one of her legs was shorter than 
the others. Were all the cats here 


wounded or sick? His belly tightened. 
Was that why Dovewing was with them? 
Was she sick? “Where is she?” he 
repeated anxiously. 

“You mean Dovewing?” Fierce 
began walking again. 

“Yes!” Anxiety pricked beneath 
Tigerheart’s fur as they passed a nest 
where two cats slept, curled together, 
their breathing rough. 

““She’s here.” Fierce ducked beneath 
a wooden ledge that sat on wooden legs. 
A pile of furless pelts made a nest 
against the wall at the back. 

Tigerheart tasted a familiar scent, 
faint among the jumble of odors. His 
heart leaped into his throat. 


“Dovewing?” 

He saw her gray fur move among the 
strange pelts, and as his eyes adjusted to 
the shadow, he made out her face. She 
was staring at him, her eyes wide. 

“Dovewing!” His heart overflowing 
with joy, he darted to her and pressed 
his cheek against hers. 

She pulled away with a hiss. “You 
didn’t meet me!” 

Flinching as though she’d raked 
claws across his muzzle, he backed 
away. Pain sliced his heart. “I’m sorry. I 
tried. I was on my way, but Scorchfur 
and Juniperclaw were going to leave 
and I had to stop them and then a badger 
attacked us. By the time I reached the 


glade, you were gone! I tried to follow, 
but there were too many monsters and 
my head hurt.” The words poured from 
him, garbled and confused. He hadn’t 
really thought about what he was going 
to say, and now the words seemed to 
tumble around each other, like play- 
fighting kits. Please understand! “I hit 
my head when we fought the badger, and 
I couldn’t cross the Thunderpath. And 
then I had a dream that told me I couldn’t 
leave ShadowClan. I wanted to. But 
ShadowClan might have disappeared if 
Pd come.” 

Dovewing looked past him. Fierce, 
Cobweb, and Ant had withdrawn and 
were watching from beyond the ledge, 


their gazes protective but not prying. She 
nodded at them and they moved away. 
Then she turned to Tigerheart. “If your 
Clan needed you so much, what are you 
doing here?” 

“I was wrong. I thought I was the 
sun, but I was the shadow. .. .” He 
trailed away, realizing he must sound 
crazy. 

Dovewing seemed unfazed. Her cold 
gaze didn’t waver. “So your Clan won’t 
disappear without you now?” 

“No.” Tigerheart gazed at her, 
desperately hoping to find enough 
warmth in her gaze to cling to. “I hope 
not. I don’t know. I just had to find you. 
ShadowClan must look after itself.” 


“So you only chose me when you 
thought your Clan didn’t need you 
anymore?” 

Dovewing’s question silenced him. 
He’d chosen her because of 
Puddleshine’s dream. But what if he had 
been the sun? Would he have stayed 
forever and become Clan leader? “I 
chose you as soon as I knew that you 
needed me more than my Clan did.” 

That was the truth. 

But what if ShadowClan had needed 
me more? 

He pushed the question away. 
Dovewing must believe that he would 
choose her over anything—even his 
Clan. 


“I love you.” He stared at her 
desperately. “I want to take care of our 
kits. I couldn’t stay away.” 

For the first time, grief shimmered in 
her eyes. “You tried to follow me?” 

Tigerheart nodded. “I followed you, 
but the badger and the dream and—” 

“Youre here now.” Dovewing 
heaved herself to her paws. 

For the first time, Tigerheart saw 
how swollen her flanks had grown. He 
hurried to her and rubbed his muzzle 
lovingly along her jaw. “I’ve missed you 
so much. How did you make the journey 
alone? Did you follow the Silverpath?” 

Dovewing sat down heavily. He 
could hear her panting, and suddenly he 


realized he could smell blood. He 
sniffed her. His whiskers brushed a 
wound on her shoulder, and the tang of 
blood and herbs filled his nose. “You’re 
hurt!” He blinked at her, his heart 
quickening. “Did it happen on the way? 
Did something attack you?” 

“Tm okay,” Dovewing reassured him 
gently. “It’s just a fox bite, and Spire has 
treated it. It’s healing fast.” 

“A fox bite?” In a flash, Tigerheart 
relived every nightmare that had haunted 
him since she’d left. She’d been so 
vulnerable on her own. How had he ever 
left her to make the journey without him? 

“It happened while I was out with 
the guardian cats,” she told him gently, 


easing down into her nest. 

“The guardian cats?” Tigerheart 
blinked at her dumbly. 

“These cats here.” Her gaze swept 
around the cave. “They take care of one 
another. And of strangers who need help 
or healing.” Her eyes rounded as she 
stared at him. “You see? My dream was 
right. I was meant to come here. Our kits 
will be safe.” 

For how long? Tigerheart’s thoughts 
spiraled. Sure, the guardian cats seemed 
kind and helpful, like a whole Clan of 
medicine cats. But what about Dash, a 
cat who didn’t even understand that cats 
were stronger together? Or Floyd, 
Scrap, and Mae? They only thought of 


themselves. Was this really a good place 
to raise kits? How could they ever learn 
to become warriors if they were 
surrounded by strays and loners? 

Dovewing was still looking at him, 
her eyes huge and dark, glittering in the 
shadows. She needed him to be strong. 
She needed him to be a warrior. She 
needed him to stand beside her. 

“Our kits will be safe here,” he 
agreed. He stepped into the nest and 
curled around her, his belly softening as 
he felt the warmth of her pelt against his. 
He wrapped his tail tightly around her 
and tucked his muzzle behind her ear. 
“Your dream was right. It has brought us 
here.” The nest was comfortable, the 


furless pelts soft against his spine. He 
relaxed into them and closed his eyes. 
“Are you hungry?” he murmured sleepily 
as she snuggled into him, purring. “Ill 
hunt for you soon. I want our kits to 
grow healthy and strong.” 

“I can hunt,” she whispered. “There 
are plenty of mice around the gathering 
place.” 

“But I want to get used to taking care 
of my kin.” Tigerheart’s words were 
slurred by sleep. 

“You always have,’ Dovewing 
murmured. “And you always will.” 

Her scent filled his nose as he 
nuzzled deep into her fur. Happiness 
moved through him like a greenleaf 


breeze and seemed to lift him gently up. 
As he breathed softly and deeply, 
drawing in her warmth, he floated into 
sleep. 


“Wake up, sleepypaws.” 

Dovewing’s_ gentle mew nudged 
Tigerheart from his slumber. Dovewing! 
He’d found her. Fresh joy flooded him. 
He smelled the scent of mouse and 
opened his eyes. Surprise spiked through 
his fur as daylight flooded his gaze. It 
was morning! He’d slept all night. He 
lifted his head sharply. “I was going to 
hunt.” Confused, he gazed around the 
den. Slowly, memories of his arrival— 
the Thundersnake, Dash, the rot piles, 
the guardian cats—flooded back. 


“I brought you this.” She nudged a 
mouse toward him. “You must be 
hungry.” 

He was. His belly was as hollow as 
a deserted rabbit hole. He licked his 
lips. “But I was going to hunt for you.” 

“Are you frightened you'll forget 
how to catch a mouse?” Dovewing’s 
green eyes sparkled teasingly. She 
looked happy. “Don’t worry, Tigerheart. 
You'll have plenty of chances to refresh 
your memory. There are a lot of mouths 
to feed here.” 

Tigerheart followed her gaze around 
the cave. In the bright morning light, it 
seemed friendlier. But the smooth walls 
and shiny floor and Twoleg clutter still 


felt strange. He leaned closer to 
Dovewing. “We’re living in a Twoleg 
den. Don’t you find it odd?” 

She shrugged. “Not anymore. 
Twolegs don’t use it,” she told him. 
“They meet upstairs every few days, but 
they don’t live there, and they never 
come down here.” 

Tigerheart glanced at the flat, square 
ceiling. “But they built this den. Why 
don’t they use it?” 

Dovewing hooked the mouse up with 
her claw and dropped it into the nest. 
“Stop worrying and eat.” 

The mouse tasted musty. There was 
no forest sweetness in its flesh, but he 
was grateful for it. As he began to eat, 


Dovewing glanced over her shoulder. A 
skinny black tom was padding toward 
them. Dovewing climbed into the nest 
beside Tigerheart and pressed against 
him. Was she frightened of this tom? He 
didn’t look dangerous, and a small 
white-and-ginger kit was following him. 

“Is this the cat you were talking 
about?” The kit wove excitedly around 
the black tom as he stopped beside the 
nest. 

Tigerheart chewed his mouse, 
curiosity pricking in his fur. The black 
tom blinked at him slowly. There was a 
remote look in his eyes that made 
Tigerheart wonder what he was thinking. 

“Yes. He must be the second one.” 


The tom’s gaze flicked over Tigerheart. 
“I was expecting two cats. Now they’re 
both finally here.” 

Tigerheart frowned. What was he 
talking about? Had he known they would 
be coming? How? 

Dovewing shifted beside him. “This 
is Spire.” She dipped her head. “He’s a 
healer here.” 

The kit puffed out his chest. “He’s 
the best healer here. He knows things no 
other cat knows. And he dreams things. 
I’m Blaze, by the way. I help Spire. And 
he looks after me.” 

Spire did not acknowledge the kit’s 
words. Instead he just turned and began 
to pad away, as abruptly as he had come. 


Tigerheart blinked at the healer, 
swallowing his mouthful. He’d seemed 
interested in their arrival. Didn’t he 
want to stay and talk? “Nice to meet 
you,” he called. 

But the tom didn’t seem to be 
listening. His head was tipped back, and 
he was staring into midair, mumbling to 
himself. Then he dropped his gaze and 
shook his head, as if answering a 
question only he could hear, asked by 
some cat only he could see. 

Blaze hurried after him. “Are you 
hungry, Spire? Shall we go and look for 
food?” 

Fierce padded past the kit. She 
flicked her tail fondly along his spine. 


“Go and ask Mittens to help you hunt,” 
she told him. 

“Okay.” Blaze caught up to Spire and 
nudged him toward a tabby tom basking 
in a strip of sunshine. 

Fierce headed toward Dovewing’s 
nest. Tigerheart swallowed the last 
morsel of mouse as she reached them. 
Cobweb and a tabby she-cat were with 
her. 

“I see you've met Spire,” Fierce 
meowed. 

“He said he was expecting us,” 
Tigerheart told her. 

“Spire says a lot of things.” Fierce 
flicked her tail. “Most of it is nonsense. 
He gets confused. But we look after him. 


And he’s a good healer.” 

“Blaze mentioned that.” Tigerheart 
looked across the cavern at the kit. He 
was nosing the tabby to his paws. 

Fierce purred. “Blaze is good for 
him. Keeps Spire’s paws on the ground 
even though his thoughts are in the 
clouds. I have no idea why a kit wants to 
spend so much time with such a strange 
cat, but they take care of each other.” 

Tigerheart looked at Dovewing. 
“You said Spire treated your fox bite,” 
he said. “Do you think he is a medicine 
cat?” 

Dovewing shrugged. “I really don’t 
know. He says he has dreams . . . but I 
don’t think they come from StarClan. 


Sometimes it seems like he just sees 
things that aren’t there.” Her fur ruffled. 
“I just wish he didn’t keep looking at me 
like he knows something about me.” She 
looked up at Fierce. “And he was acting 
weird with Tigerheart just now, too.” 

Fierce’s eyes rounded with interest. 
“Really?” 

Beside her, the tabby she-cat’s ears 
twitched. “Sometimes Spire gets his 
weird dreams mixed up with reality. He 
probably thinks you can fly.” She purred 
at Tigerheart. 

“This is Cinnamon.” Fierce 
introduced the brown tabby, who shifted 
her white paws shyly and dipped her 
head in greeting. 


“Hi, Cinnamon.” 

As Tigerheart nodded in return, 
Fierce blinked at Dovewing. “I’m glad 
your mate has come at last.” She turned 
to Tigerheart. “Dovewing’s told us about 
you.” 

Tigerheart wondered guiltily what 
Dovewing had said. “I should have 
made the journey with her.” His pelt 
prickled self-consciously. Did they think 
he’d let her down? 

“You're here now,” Fierce meowed. 
“And Pm hoping you can help us. 
Dovewing says you’re a warrior too.” 

Cobweb leaned forward. “She says 
all cats are warriors where you come 
from. She says you live in Clans. It 


sounds like a strange way of life.” 

“No stranger than this.” Tigerheart 
glanced around the cavern. These cats 
were different from Dash and the rot pile 
cats. They understood what it meant to 
take care of one another. “How did you 
come to live like this?” 

Fierce shrugged. “Who knows? Sick 
cats come and go. Some of us with 
wounds that will never fully heal stay 
on.” She glanced at her short leg. “It’s 
safer to have friends. And we each do 
what we are best at. Some heal; some 
hunt; some guard.” 

Cinnamon’s gaze flicked over 
Tigerheart. “He looks fit. He might be 
useful.” 


“Of course he'll be useful,” 
Dovewing lifted her muzzle proudly. “I 
just wish I could help too.” 

Fierce looked at her sternly. “You 
need to worry about keeping those kits 
safe. Look what happened last time you 
tried to help.” She glanced at 
Dovewing’s shoulder wound. 

Dovewing’s eyes flashed with 
frustration. “I didn’t think my belly 
would get in the way of my fighting 
moves.” 

Alarm flickered in  Tigerheart’s 
belly. “Yov ve been fighting?” 

“We’re having trouble with a fox,” 
Fierce told him. 

“It’s stopping us from gathering 


herbs,” Cobweb explained. 

Cinnamon flicked her _ tail-tip. 
“Dovewing said that a few warrior 
moves would get rid of it, but hers aren’t 
too good at the moment.” 

“She tried to teach us some,” 
Cobweb chipped in. 

“Dovewing is too close to kitting to 
train us properly,” Fierce meowed. She 
glanced over her shoulder at the cats 
moving around the cavern. “We’ve 
learned a few moves, but she says we’ll 
need to fight together if we want to drive 
off a fox.” 

“Tt looks like you already work well 
together.” Tigerheart gazed around the 
Twoleg cave. Ant was waiting beside 


the drip-pipe with a wad of furless pelt 
to soak up water. A tortoiseshell she-cat 
was stripping tiny leaves from a twig 
and laying them on the side of Rascal’s 
nest. A  brown-and-white tom was 
jumping down from the cave entrance 
beside the clear wall. A rat dangled 
from his jaws. He carried it to the nest 
where the sickly she-cat lay. “Where did 
you learn your medicine skills?” 

“A stray named Pumpkin stayed with 
us. He’d lived with forest cats and 
learned that herbs could be useful,” 
Fierce explained. 

Forest cats? Had Pumpkin stayed 
with a Clan? Tigerheart had never heard 
talk of such a cat. He wondered if 


Pumpkin might have stayed with 
SkyClan while they were still at the 
gorge. 

Fierce went on. “He knew a few 
herbs and taught us what they looked and 
smelled like. Since then he’s moved on, 
and we’ve experimented with new herbs 
and found what works and what doesn’t. 
We realized that common sense is as 
important as herbs when it comes to 
treating the sick and injured. We’ve 
collected a lot of knowledge about 
healing. But fighting needs different 
skills. We were hoping you could teach 
us.” 

That must have been why Spire was 
relieved he had come. He’d been hoping 


some cat would help them drive the fox 
away from the herbs. 

“Well?” Fierce was staring at him. 

Tigerheart dipped his head. He 
admired her directness. Her request was 
simple, and she offered nothing in return. 
How different she was from Dash. He 
was relieved that not all city cats were 
the same. “So the fox is keeping you 
from the herbs?” 

“Nothing much grows here,” 
Cobweb chimed. “But we found a space 
where we can get nearly all the herbs we 
need. We’ve gathered leaves there for 
moons.” 

Tigerheart nodded. “But now the fox 
has taken over the land.” He glanced at 


Dovewing’s wound. “Was it the same 
fox who did that?” 

“Yes. We need to drive it away and 
gather herbs before the cold weather 
kills the plants.” Fierce looked at him 
unwaveringly. “Will you help us?” 

“Of course.” If this place was going 
to be their home for now, Tigerheart 
would defend it as fiercely as he’d 
defend ShadowClan territory. “Show me 
this land. I want to know what we’re 
dealing with.” 

He felt Dovewing stiffen beside him. 
“Yow Il be careful, won’t you?” 

“This patrol will just be to check out 
the fox’s territory,” Tigerheart told her. 
“Let’s find out whether it’s dug a den or 


is just passing through.” He looked at 
Fierce. “It may just be a youngster 
looking for somewhere to settle, or it 
could be a mother looking for 
somewhere to raise cubs. Whichever it 
is, it’s better to know. It could be serious 
trouble.” 

Fierce dipped her head. “Thank 
you.” She turned toward the cavern 
entrance, flicking her tail decisively. 
“PII lead you there. Cobweb, Cinnamon, 
Ant.” She raised her voice as she called 
across the space to where the scarred 
brown-and-black tom was swallowing 
the last mouthfuls of a mouse. Ant 
looked up eagerly. 

“We’re going to show Tigerheart the 


herb patch,” Fierce told him. 

“Are we going to fight that fox?” Ant 
hurried to join them. 

“Let’s check it out first,’ Tigerheart 
told him. “Fighting foxes is one thing; 
driving them away for good is another.” 

Fierce crossed the cavern and 
leaped onto the wooden ledge. As 
Tigerheart followed with the others, she 
scrambled through the gap beside the 
clear wall and disappeared outside. 
Tigerheart paused on the wooden ledge 
while Cobweb, Cinnamon and Ant filed 
past him. He glanced back at Dovewing. 
She was settling into her nest, yawning. 
Affection flooded him as he watched her 
curl into the old pelts. Her belly was 


swollen with his kits. Before long, 
they’d be a family. A purr rumbled in his 
throat. Thank you, StarClan, for guiding 
me here. 





CHAPTER 15 
Cog 


Tigerheart followed Fierce, Ant, 
Cinnamon, and Cobweb, hardly daring 
to glance sideways for fear of losing 
them as they dodged between towering 
dens and teeming Thunderpaths. The 
howl of the city was even louder this 
morning. Twolegs swarmed everywhere. 
Clear walls reflected bright sunlight. 
Monsters barked and shrieked. 

Hurrying after Cobweb, Tigerheart 
kept his ears pressed flat as they ducked 
beneath a sleeping monster and waited 
for a moment, then darted through a 
flood of monsters that had ground 


suddenly to a halt. How did they know 
when it was safe to cross? How did they 
remember the route? Scents 
overwhelmed him. The noise and 
movement disoriented him. He prayed he 
wouldn’t lose sight of the guardian cats. 
If he did, how would he ever find his 
way back to the gathering place and to 
Dovewing? 

The thought alarmed him, and he 
focused even more determinedly on 
Cobweb’s tail as it disappeared around 
a corner onto a quieter stretch of stone. 

Fierce slowed and glanced at the 
blue sky, which showed in a strip 
between the Twoleg dens on either side. 
Tigerheart felt like he was looking up 


from the bottom of a huge canyon. “Are 
we nearly there?” he asked. It seemed a 
long and dangerous route to the herb 
patch. 

“The dens disappear at the end of 
this alley,” Fierce told him. “No more 
Twolegs, just monsters and 
Thunderpaths.” 

Just monsters and Thunderpaths! She 
sounded so casual. “Won’t that be 
dangerous?” 

“Its okay,” Ant reassured him. “We 
know a safe route.” 

Tigerheart glanced at the tom 
skeptically. Was any route safe in this 
place? 

At the end of the alley, the land 


opened out. The Twoleg dens ended, and 
ahead of them stretched a maze of 
Thunderpaths. Monsters zipped along 
them, the air foul with their fumes. 
Tigerheart blinked in surprise as he saw 
a Thunderpath arching over the others. 
Its vast legs plunged wide stone paws 
into the earth below. 

Cinnamon pointed her muzzle toward 
a green slope beneath the soaring 
Thunderpath. “That’s where the herbs 
grow.” 

Tigerheart stared cross the 
Thunderpaths twining between him and 
the herb patch. “How in StarClan do we 
reach it?” 

“This way.” Fierce hurried along the 


side of a wide Thunderpath. Monsters 
whipped past them, tugging at his fur. 
Their roar made his ears tremble, but 
Tigerheart saw with a rush of relief that 
Fierce was heading toward a ditch 
beside the Thunderpath. There was a gap 
beneath it. A tunnel! 

Excitedly, he followed Fierce, 
Cobweb, Ant, and Cinnamon into the 
dark hole. It was no bigger than a badger 
run. Its smooth, rounded walls echoed as 
they splashed through the shallow water 
running along the bottom of the tunnel. 
Tigerheart wrinkled his nose as he felt 
slimy stone beneath his paws and 
smelled the stench of ditch water. But at 
least it would get them safely to the other 


side of the Thunderpath. 

Fierce led them from one tunnel to 
another until, at last, they emerged on the 
green slope beneath the flying 
Thunderpath. 

Tigerheart looked up nervously at the 
wide stone path that arced over their 
heads. Its wide leg was planted firmly at 
the top of the slope. Low bushes and 
grass sprouted against it. The slope was 
dotted with scrubby plants, their leaves 
dusty from the stench of the Thunderpath. 
“Are these the herbs you use? Don’t they 
taste bad?” 

“We wash them before we use them 
to get the monster stink off,” Fierce told 
him. 


Cobweb was already hurrying 
toward the stone leg, sniffing eagerly at 
one of the plants. “The willow herb is 
doing well.” 

Ant wove around a dark green bush 
topped with white-and-yellow flowers. 
“The feverfew is ready for gathering.” 

“At least foxes don’t eat herbs.” 
Fierce was glancing around the slope 
warily. 

Tigerheart followed her gaze. He 
tasted the air, reaching for the scent of 
fox among the monster stench. He caught 
a whiff and stiffened. The smell was 
fresh. “We should stick close to one 
another,” he warned Fierce. 

Fierce signaled to the patrol with her 


tail. “Let’s check the herbs once we’ve 
solved the fox problem.” 

“But it’s  might-chill already,” 
Cobweb meowed anxiously. “If we wait 
until ice-chill, the frost will have killed 
the freshest leaves.” 

Tigerheart guessed that night-chill 
must be leaf-fall, and ice-chill was leaf- 
bare. 

Fierce glanced along the slope. 
“We’re still half a moon away from 
frost.” 

“If we’re lucky,’ Cobweb argued. 
“If we don’t gather herbs soon, we’ll 
have to wait until warmingtime.” 

Does he mean newleaf? Despite 
their strange words, these cats faced the 


same problems as medicine cats in the 
forest. Hadn’t Puddleshine been pressing 
Rowanstar to send out herb-gathering 
parties in the quarter moon before 
Tigerheart left? 

“Lets check the whole slope,” he 
suggested. “I want to find out if this fox 
has made a den. And I need to find more 
of its scent. ’'m not sure if it’s a dog fox 
or a vixen.” A vixen would be harder to 
drive out, especially if she’d already 
dug a den. 

Fierce dipped her head and began to 
lead the patrol through the bushes. 
Tigerheart pricked his ears. The fox had 
been here recently, but he knew that 
foxes tended to sleep during the day. 


Perhaps they’d catch it napping. He 
picked up a fox scent and whispered to 
Fierce. “This way.” Heading into a 
stretch of long grass, he followed the 
scent trail that drifted from the green 
stems. The Thunderpath soaring 
overheard cut a wide shadow over the 
slope. Tigerheart shivered in the chilly 
wind that funneled beneath it. Cobweb 
and Ant pressed close behind. Cinnamon 
and Fierce followed. As Tigerheart led 
the patrol uphill, a huge monster roared 
on the Thunderpath at the bottom of the 
slope. He flattened his ears against the 
roar and narrowed his eyes, scanning for 
movement ahead. 

A growl sounded beside them. 


Tigerheart’s chest tightened. The fox! He 
turned, unsheathing his claws as red fur 
exploded from the grass. It sent Cobweb 
and Ant tumbling. Tigerheart smelled 
dog fox. Thinking fast, he leaped as it 
snapped at Cobweb, who was struggling 
to find his paws. Hooking his claws into 
the fox’s fur, Tigerheart tugged it back in 
time for Cobweb to escape. 

Ant was already back on his paws. 
With a hiss, the tom swung a paw at the 
fox’s nose. The fox lunged at him, its 
eyes sparkling with rage. Ant ducked 
just in time and, dodging beneath the 
fox’s chin, spun and aimed another blow 
at its muzzle. Fierce leaped onto the 
fox’s back and sank her teeth into its 


shoulder. Cinnamon snapped at its hind 
paw and sank in her teeth. The fox 
yelped and shook Fierce off, turning to 
snarl at Cinnamon. 

Tigerheart hesitated, watching the 
guardian cats fight. They were brave and 
fast, but their attacks were hasty and 
uncoordinated. Each cat fought as if 
facing the fox alone. Each attack 
distracted the fox from the one before, 
but none was fierce enough to frighten it. 
They’re just making it angry. Tigerheart 
could see frustration flashing in the fox’s 
eyes as it responded to each assault, 
turning to meet one and then another. 
With a sudden bark of rage, it darted at 
Cobweb, sank its teeth into the tom’s 


spine, and shook him. Cobweb shrieked 
with pain and fear. 

Tigerheart flung himself beneath the 
fox’s belly. “Bite its tail!” he ordered 
Fierce. “Get on its back!” he yowled at 
Ant. “Claw its throat!” he told 
Cinnamon. As the three guardian cats 
leaped to obey, Tigerheart twisted under 
the fox’s belly and began churning his 
hind paws at the soft flesh above him. 

As the cats swarmed around him, the 
fox yowled in pain. Cobweb dropped to 
the ground. His flank thumped the earth, 
and for a moment, he was still. 
Tigerheart glanced at him. Was he dead? 
Then the smoky gray tom twitched and 
groaned on the grass. The fox turned on 


the others. Tigerheart darted from 
beneath its belly and leaped to stand 
beside them. The fox stared at them as 
Cobweb scrambled to his paws. 
Tigerheart felt a surge of triumph as 
doubt flashed in the fox’s eyes. Tts 
scared. 

Suddenly the fox’s gaze flicked past 
them. Its expression changed in an 
instant. Joy, so malicious that it made 
Tigerheart’s blood freeze, sparked in its 
eyes. A growl sounded behind them. Two 
foxes. He spun and saw a vixen padding 
toward them, her teeth bared. 

“Cobweb! Get up!” Tigerheart stared 
desperately at the injured tom. “We’ve 
got to get out of here.” These cats didn’t 


have the skill to fight two foxes at once. 

Fierce flung herself toward the dog 
fox, hissing and snarling, swiping her 
paws so wildly that it drove the fox 
backward. Ant darted toward Cobweb 
and nudged the smoky tom to his paws. 
Tigerheart turned to face the advancing 
vixen. Cinnamon pressed against his 
side. Together they reared as the fox 
leaped at them. Flailing wildly, they 
pushed it back. “Run!” He yowled at 
Fierce and Ant as they helped Cobweb 
down the slope. His gaze flicked to 
Cinnamon. “You too!” 

She searched his gaze. “What about 
you?” 

“PII follow,” he promised. 


As she raced after her friends, 
Tigerheart faced the foxes alone. They 
slid together and snarled at him 
menacingly. Fear closed his throat. He 
wanted to give the guardian cats a 
chance to get Cobweb clear. But he 
couldn’t fight two foxes either. He 
backed away as they advanced. Blood 
roared in his ears. Showing his teeth, he 
bushed out his fur. As he glanced down 
the slope and saw Fierce guiding 
Cobweb and the others into the tunnel, 
the foxes rushed him. Their eyes 
glittered with glee. Swiping out one 
paw, then another, Tigerheart caught the 
muzzle of each. But they were on him. 
The force of their hard, strong bodies 


knocked him backward. He landed 
clumsily and turned. He had to flee. Hot 
breath bathed his tail as he hared down 
the slope. The tunnel was only a tree- 
length away. Run! The others had 
already disappeared into the shadows. 
He leaped for the entrance, panic 
scorching through his heart. Sharp teeth 
caught his tail. Agony seared like fire as 
he felt his fur rip. Ducking into the 
tunnel, he ran. Water sprayed out behind 
him as he pelted through the darkness. 
His tail shrilled with pain, and he 
glanced over his shoulder. Two pairs of 
eyes peered down the tunnel. The foxes 
had stopped at the entrance and were 
watching him flee. 


Ahead, he could make out the shapes 
of the guardian cats against the flood of 
light at the far end of the tunnel. He 
splashed his way through and emerged a 
few moments after them onto the dirty 
strip of grass between two 
Thunderpaths. Deaf to the monsters 
streaking past either side, he stared 
wide-eyed at the guardian cats. “They’re 
mates,” he puffed. “The foxes are 
mates.” He saw by the darkness in 
Fierce’s eyes that she understood. If a 
pair of foxes had taken over their herb 
land, before long there would be cubs— 
and so many foxes that they would never 
be able to gather herbs there again. 





CHAPTER 16 
Cog 


“We're healers, not fighters.” 
Pipsqueak, a brown-and-white tom, 
squared up to Tigerheart in the middle of 
the cavern beneath the gathering place. 

“But Fierce says the cats who stay 
on here each have their own role,” 
Tigerheart reminded him. “She said 
some heal, some hunt, and some guard.” 

Dotty, a pale white-and-ginger she- 
cat, padded to Pipsqueak’s side. 
“Keeping watch and warning if danger is 
near is different from mounting an attack 
on a pair of foxes.” 

In the two days since the fight with 


the foxes, Tigerheart’s tail had healed, 
thanks to the poultice Spire had smeared 
over the torn fur. At first Tigerheart had 
been concerned that Spire was 
inexperienced, because he kept 
mumbling, “Is this right?” as he prepared 
the salve. But after a while, he began to 
wonder—could Spire be seeking 
guidance from some unseen mentor? 

The guardian cats’ herb store was 
running low, and a chill in the air 
warned that frost might come sooner 
rather than later. Frost would kill the 
leaves the healers needed to see them 
through leaf-bare. Besides, they needed 
to drive the foxes away before the pair 
settled into a den. They couldn’t afford 


to wait until any cubs were born; 
Tigerheart knew that as soon as the vixen 
was expecting, the foxes would be 
fighting for their young. It would be 
impossible to win a battle for the land, 
and the guardian cats’ precious herb 
source could be lost within a moon. 
Tigerheart had assembled the 
guardian cats in a circle while 
Dovewing rested in their nest. He 
wanted to teach them how to fight. 
Tigerheart glanced around the circle. 
Fierce hung back, curiosity flashing in 
her bright green gaze. Blaze was 
watching excitedly beside Spire. The 
strange healer’s gaze was drifting as 
usual, following the dust motes that hung 


in the shafts of sunshine cutting the air. 
Ant and Cinnamon shifted their paws 
impatiently. Tigerheart knew that they, at 
least, wanted to learn battle moves. 
Cobweb was still recovering from the 
bitemarks the fox had left on his back. 
But Boots, the one-eyed tabby who had 
tended to him, said the wound was 
superficial: _Cobweb’s spine was 
unharmed. The long-furred gray tom 
watched from his nest now, his eyes still 
dull with pain while Boots sat beside 
him. Rascal and Mittens, the tabbies 
known best for their hunting skills, eyed 
Tigerheart with interest, exchanging 
glances as Pipsqueak and Dotty stared at 
him challengingly. 


Peanut, a healer cat, caught 
Tigerheart’s eye. “We need to restock the 
herb store soon,” she mewed, flicking 
her gaze from Tigerheart to Dotty. “And 
if that means fighting, we should fight. 
Cats’ lives may depend on it.” 

Dotty stared back at her. “You won’t 
be doing the fighting,” she pointed out. 
“You're a healer here. You barely hunt.” 

Fierce padded forward at last. 
Tigerheart’s belly sparked with hope. 

“Tf you don’t want to fight, then don’t 
fight,” she mewed casually. 

Tigerheart stared at her. “You should 
encourage them!” 

Her eyes widened. “Why me?” 

“You're the leader.” She acted like 


one, and all the cats dipped their heads 
in respect when they greeted her. 

“You seem to have misunderstood.” 
Fierce flicked her tail. “We are equals 
here. This isn’t a Clan.” She spoke the 
word as though the strangeness of 
warriors was beyond her understanding. 

Irritation pricked in Tigerheart’s 
pelt. “If you want to protect your 
territory, you’re going to have to start 
thinking like a Clan.” 

“We don’t have territory,” Dotty 
mewed querulously. “We simply shelter 
here and take care of one another.” 

“What’s the land you gather herbs on 
if not territory?” Tigerheart challenged. 

“It’s just land,” Pipsqueak meowed. 


Tigerheart’s ears twitched. “So you 
don’t mind foxes taking it?” 

“Of course we mind,” Pipsqueak 
snapped. “We need the herbs.” 

“Then youre going to have to fight 
for them!” Tigerheart raised his voice, 
looking pleadingly at Fierce. Hadn’t she 
asked him directly for this help? Why 
wasn’t she supporting him now? 

Fierce padded around Pipsqueak and 
Dotty. “This warrior does have a point,” 
she mewed casually. “We all joined this 
community because we needed help or 
Shelter. Without herbs, some of us 
wouldn’t be here now, and we owe it to 
future visitors to give them the same care 
we received.” 


Pipsqueak tipped his head 
thoughtfully. “Are you telling us to 
fight?” 

Tigerheart’s belly fluttered with 
hope. 

Fierce glanced into a shaft of 
sunlight. “If we learn fighting skills, we 
can drive the foxes away and gather all 
the herbs we want. But it’s your choice. 
Learn to fight or don’t. It’s up to you.” 

Dotty narrowed her eyes. “Are you 
going to let this warrior teach you how 
to fight, Fierce?” 

“Of course.” Fierce stopped in front 
of Tigerheart. “I think he has a lot of 
useful knowledge. It seems foolish not to 
learn from him.” 


He blinked at her gratefully. She was 
going to convince them! 

Ant padded forward. “I want to learn 
how to fight too.” 

“And me.” Cinnamon joined him. 

Rascal and Mittens looked at each 
other. 

“There are foxes everywhere in this 
city,” Rascal meowed. 

“And dogs.” Mittens whisked his 
tail. “We’d be pigeon-brained not to 
learn some fighting skills from a 
warrior.” 

Tigerheart blinked at Pipsqueak and 
Dotty. Were they going to agree too? 

“I guess there’s no harm in learning,” 
Pipsqueak conceded. 


“So long as this outsider doesn’t 
start thinking of himself as our leader,” 
Dotty mewed. 

“We’re equals here,” Pipsqueak 
reminded Tigerheart. 

“I only want to help.” As Tigerheart 
dipped his head modestly, his thoughts 
flitted back to ShadowClan. Scorchfur 
and Snowbird had practically begged 
him to lead them. Here the cats didn’t 
want anyone to lead them, especially not 
him. His frustration with the guardian 
cats melted away. It felt good not to be 
weighed down by responsibility. These 
cats only wanted to learn a few battle 
moves that would help them save their 
herb patch. Their simplicity warmed 


him, and he purred. “Let’s start.” He 
padded to the center of the cavern and 
dropped into the first battle crouch 
Oakfur had ever taught him. He looked 
around at the watching cats. “This is the 
easiest position to launch most battle 
moves from.” 

Before long, the guardian cats were 
practicing moves on one another while 
Tigerheart wove among them, adjusting 
crouches and advising which paw was 
the best to lead with or to push back on. 
As he moved from one cat to another, he 
remembered training Sleekpaw. He had 
spent long days in the forest with his 
apprentice, going over moves that could 
defeat ThunderClan, or confuse a 


RiverClan cat, or unbalance a lithe 
WindClan warrior. That was before the 
apprentices had turned on their own 
Clan, before the rogues had come and 
trouble had torn ShadowClan apart. The 
memory pierced his heart like a thorn, 
and he jerked his thoughts back to the 
present. These cats were learning how to 
defeat foxes, not warriors. There were 
no rogues here, or Clans to betray. 

Tigerheart looked toward the nest 
where Dovewing was sleeping, her chin 
hooked over the side. She looked so 
peaceful and content, her eyes closed, 
her ears twitching as she dreamed. She 
and their kits were all he needed to 
worry about now. 


Fierce’s mew surprised him. “I think 
we've learned enough basic moves. We 
need to come up with a plan.” 

Dovewing opened her eyes and 
gazed sleepily at the cats. Tigerheart 
blinked at her reassuringly and turned to 
Fierce. “A plan to deal with the foxes?” 

Fierce nodded. 

“We need to remember that we are 
not fighting alone, but together.” 
Tigerheart remembered the skirmish on 
the slope. The cats had fought bravely 
but had been uncoordinated. He looked 
seriously around the guardian cats, who 
had turned to face him. “Be aware of the 
cats around you. Fit your moves with 
theirs. Let your attacks fill gaps they 


have left. See openings you can use, and 
always distract your enemy if you see 
your Clanmate in trouble.” He corrected 
himself as he saw confusion flutter in 
their gazes. “If you see your friend in 
trouble.” He hesitated. Did these cats 
see one another as friends, or merely as 
cats they lived beside? 

Gray fur moved at the edge of his 
vision. Dovewing was padding toward 
them. “I’ve been thinking about how to 
start the attack on the foxes.” She 
stopped beside Tigerheart and sat down 
heavily, clearly still sleepy. “If the 
patrol can take up positions around the 
slope, one cat can wait in the middle as 
bait.” 


“Bait?” Tigerheart looked at her, 
unease rippling through his fur. 

“To make the foxes think there’s no 
threat, so we can catch them off guard.” 
she explained. “A cat who looks 
harmless.” She shifted her swollen belly 
as though it was uncomfortable. “Like 
me.” 

“No!” Fierce cried out before 
Tigerheart could open his mouth. 

“How could you put your kits in 
danger?” Dotty looked at her in shock. 

“Youre too fat to run away,” Ant 
pointed out. 

Tigerheart stared at Dovewing 
sternly. “You’re not going anywhere near 
the herb patch.” 


“But I want to help,’ Dovewing 
objected. “And [ll worry about you if 
I’m not there.” 

“T could be the bait.” Spire padded 
forward. For once, his gaze was fixed on 
the other cats. He looked from Fierce to 
Tigerheart, his yellow eyes glittering. 
“Pm skinny and small, and I look 
harmless and half-crazy most of the 
time.” 

“You don’t look half—” 

Spire cut Fierce off. “I know my 
thoughts wander and I often seem lost. 
But I’m no fool. These foxes need to go. 
That herb patch is important. I’m fast on 
my paws, and I trust you to protect me.” 
His gaze swept around the guardian cats. 


They nodded solemnly. 

“Are you sure?” Fierce asked. 
“Yow ll need to keep your mind on what 
you're doing.” 

“Pm sure,” Spire promised her. 
“And I will.” 

Tigerheart searched the strange tom’s 
gaze anxiously. “You'll 
concentrate?” He still wasn’t sure what 
to make of Spire’s conversations with 
invisible cats. Surely he couldn’t be 
talking to StarClan. But Tigerheart 
couldn’t help worrying what might 
happen if one of them suddenly wanted 
to talk to him while he was out playing 
fox bait. 

Spire flicked his tail. “Yes.” He 


winked at Tigerheart. “I know you think 
I’m a featherbrain, but there’s more to 
me than meets the eye. You'll grow to 
like me eventually. We might even 
become friends one day.” 

Tigerheart blinked at him. Would 
they be here long enough to become 
good friends with any of these cats? 
Once Dovewing had kitted and the kits 
were weaned and ready to travel, he’d 
thought that perhaps he’d be able to 
persuade Dovewing to return to the 
Clans. And yet, why should they? He 
liked the simplicity of this group: There 
were no leaders, no grudges, and no 
responsibility except to take care of the 
weak. Did he really want to rush back to 


a Clan on the brink of collapse and be 
caught up once more in a storm of 
distrust, betrayal, and recrimination? 

Blaze bounced forward and began 
brushing around Spire. “You’re so 
brave! I want to come with you. I could 
be bait with you. A fox wouldn’t suspect 
a kit.” 

Spire touched his muzzle to the top 
of the kit’s head. “You have to stay here 
with Dovewing. You can keep her busy 
so she doesn’t worry about Tigerheart.” 

Tigerheart’s whiskers twitched with 
amusement as the healer flashed him a 
knowing look. Spire knew exactly how 
to distract Blaze—perhaps he wasn’t so 
crazy after all. 


Blaze puffed out his chest. “I can do 
that.” He hurried toward Dovewing. 
“Pm the best at keeping cats busy. Spire 
tells me I keep him busy all the time. 
With me around, you won’t even think 
about Tigerheart.” 

“She won’t need to.” Fierce lifted 
her chin. “With a little more training, we 
will be able to fight those foxes off 
easily.” 

Rascal narrowed his eyes 
thoughtfully. “How do we make sure 
they stay away?” 

Mittens nodded. “We don’t want to 
have to fight them every time we gather 
herbs.” 

The guardian cats looked toward 


Tigerheart expectantly. He blinked at 
them. He couldn’t believe he hadn’t told 
them already. “That’s simple. We’ll 
block up their den. My mentor taught me 
that if you block a fox’s den, it never 
comes back. Foxes are far too lazy to dig 
the same den twice.” 

Fierce padded around the circle of 
cats, her tail whisking. “Let’s get back to 
training then. The sooner we drive those 
foxes away, the better.” 


The next day, as the sun lifted over 
the soaring Thunderpath and cast the 
herb patch into shadow, Tigerheart 
crouched between the bushes near the 
top. From here he could see the scrub 
and grass twitching below. The guardian 


cats were hiding there. In the center, 
where the foliage opened onto a clear 
stretch of grass, Spire padded around 
distractedly. He gazed into the air and 
batted invisible prey. Tigerheart hoped 
he was pretending. 

When he saw the gleam in Spire’s 
eyes, he realized that the skinny tom 
knew exactly what he was doing. With a 
flick of his tail, Spire lifted his head and 
let out a mournful yowl. 

Tigerheart’s pelt prickled. That 
would get the foxes’ attention, surely? 

A growl sounded from the top corner 
of the patch, where the stone leg of the 
soaring Thunderpath reached into the 
earth. Tigerheart jerked his muzzle 


toward the sound and saw a red pelt 
streak through the scrub. It darted toward 
Spire, lips drawn back in a threatening 
sneer. Spire blinked at it, then shot away 
beneath a low-spreading juniper. As the 
fox raced after him, Fierce exploded 
from her hiding place. With a hiss, she 
swiped her claws along the fox’s flank. 
It turned, snarling at her, its gaze 
turning quickly from surprise to fury. 
Slinking low to the ground, it advanced 
on her. Tigerheart forced his paws to 
stay still. He wanted to rush in to help, 
but he had to trust that the guardian cats 
would stick to their plan. Relief sparked 
in his belly as Cinnamon and Ant leaped 
from their hiding place and flanked the 


fox. Pipsqueak leaped out behind it. The 
fox was surrounded. It spun, its long 
body curving as it took in the sight of 
four cats. Alarm sparked in its gaze. It 
showed its sharp teeth and dropped its 
head. Tigerheart’s breath caught in his 
throat. A cornered fox was more 
dangerous than a full set of badgers. 
Wildness shone in its eye, and it lunged 
for Fierce, its jaws snapping at her paws 
as she leaped clear. Cinnamon and Ant 
leaped at its flanks, tearing at its pelt 
with outstretched claws. Pipsqueak 
caught hold of its tail and bit in hard. 
Yelping with pain, the fox thrashed 
desperately as the guardian cats clung 
on. Fierce hissed at it and raked her 


claws across its muzzle. 

Tigerheart still held his breath. The 
vixen must be close. Foxes rarely left 
each other’s side once they’d mated. He 
saw red fur near the Thunderpath leg. 
That must be where the den was. “She’s 
coming!” With a yowl, he charged 
forward, blocking the vixen’s path to its 
mate. As it crashed from the 
undergrowth, he faced it. Anger bristled 
through its pelt as it saw him. Instantly it 
tried to snatch at his ear, its jaws 
snapping shut a whisker away as he 
ducked clear. With relief, he saw Rascal 
and Mittens dart from their hiding 
places. Dotty leaped from hers, aiming 
for the second fox’s tail as they'd 


planned. As she sank her teeth into the 
thick brush, Rascal and Mittens copied 
Cinnamon and Ant’s tactic and leaped 
for the vixen’s flanks. Tigerheart faced 
its muzzle, triumph surging in his chest. 
It staggered under the weight of the 
others. He swiped his claws across its 
nose. Confusion and panic lit its eyes. Its 
mate had been dragged to the ground. 
Fierce, Ant, Cinnamon, and Pipsqueak 
clawed at it with such speed and 
ferocity, it could only flail its paws and 
snap. With a yelp, the vixen called to its 
mate. The dog fox scrabbled free of its 
attackers. Shrieking in terror, both fled 
through the scrub, their shredded tails 
bobbing behind them as they 


disappeared from the herb patch. 

Fierce met Tigerheart’s gaze, her fur 
bushed with excitement. “We did it!” 

Cinnamon, Ant, and Pipsqueak wove 
around each other happily while Rascal, 
Mittens, and Dotty congratulated one 
another. 

“You moved so fast! Dotty told 
Mittens. 

“You got such a good grip on its tail, 
it didn’t know what to do!” Rascal 
praised her. 

Tigerheart shook out his fur, a purr 
rippling through him as he let his eyes 
rove over all the guardian cats. None of 
them had been hurt, and the foxes had 
fled. They had won! 


He glanced toward the wide stone 
leg where the foxes had been nesting. 
“Let’s block up their den in case they 
find the courage to come back.” 


His paws ached by the time he 
slumped down beside Dovewing in the 
cavern. Late-afternoon sunshine filled 
the Twoleg space with rosy light. He’d 
spent the afternoon with the others, 
hauling rocks and earth to the foxes’ den 
and filling it so thoroughly that no fox 
would ever have the patience to unearth 
it. 

Rascal and Mittens had left the 
patrol early to hunt, and they slid through 
the entrance now, mice dangling from 
their jaws. They jumped from the ledge 


and crossed the space, where the 
guardian cats had gathered to celebrate 
their victory. Dropping their catch in the 
middle, they nodded to Fierce, who was 
washing mud from her paws. 

“We met Boots and Bracken while 
we were hunting,” Mittens told her. 
“They’re bringing more prey. There will 
be food for every cat.” 

Fierce nodded to the tabby tom, her 
eyes shining. “Thank you.” 

Mittens picked up two mice by their 
tails and carried them toward Tigerheart 
and Dovewing. He dropped them at their 
paws. “Thanks for your help today.” 

“Thanks for yours.” Tigerheart 
pointed his muzzle toward a huge pile of 


herbs at the side of the cavern. “Spire 
and Peanut gathered a lot of leaves.” 

Spire was lying next to Blaze nearby, 
his gaze clear and happy. “Once I’ve 
sorted and dried them, we’ll have 
enough herbs for a moon.” 

Blaze snuggled closer to the skinny 
tom. “Will you teach me which herb is 
which?” 

“Of course.” Spire lapped the kit’s 
head. 

Pipsqueak and Dotty stretched 
happily in the sunshine pooling on the 
floor. 

“I didn’t think we could actually do 
it,” Pipsqueak admitted. 

Tigerheart blinked at him. “When 


cats work together, they can do 
anything.” 

As he spoke, Boots and Bracken 
jumped down from the entrance. They 
were carrying prey as they’d promised 
and dropped it beside the rest. 

Tigerheart rubbed his cheek against 
Dovewing’s as he watched the guardian 
cats settle beside one another to eat. 
“Tm glad we came here,” he murmured. 

“Really?” She blinked at him, her 
eyes round. 

“We've helped these cats. And 
everyone seems happy.” After the unease 
and mistrust that had permeated 
ShadowClan for so long, the simple 
worries and joys of the guardian cats 


seemed a relief. 

Dovewing’s gaze softened. “So... 
are you Starting to feel like you belong 
here?” 

Tigerheart felt his spine stiffen. That 
wasn’t what he’d meant. “I guess,” he 
told her. “For now.” 

Dovewing said nothing. She just 
leaned against him, and Tigerheart felt 
the contented purr as her ribs swelled to 
nudge his. “I’m so happy you like it 
here... ,” she murmured. 

Tigerheart’s belly churned. Fighting 
beside the guardian cats had felt good, 
but he’d still assumed that, eventually, 
they’d return to the lake . . . even though, 
lately, his Clanmates seemed more 


interested in fighting one another than 
their enemies. After all, he and 
Dovewing were warriors. Surely they 
would raise their kits to be, too? 

Life here might be simpler, he 
thought, but, without kin—without a 
Clan—will our kits be anything but 
strays? 





CHAPTER 17 
Cog 


Tigerheart opened his eyes. Dawn light 
filtered through the high stretches of 
clear wall. Dovewing was sleeping 
beside him. He let himself wake slowly. 
In the days since he’d helped chase the 
foxes away, he’d grown accustomed to 
the slow pace of life among the guardian 
cats. There were no dawn patrols, no 
borders to mark, no dens or camp walls 
to repair. He could hunt when he liked, 
bringing food back for the others as well 
as for Dovewing and himself. He’d 
accompanied a patrol to the herb patch 
to gather leaves and checked the blocked 


fox den. There was no sign the foxes had 
returned; their scent was all but gone, 
replaced by Thunderpath smells. 

Now he gazed lazily around the 
cluttered cavern. The guardian cats were 
still sleeping, except Boots, who was 
murmuring softly to Marigold, the old 
black cat who had hardly left her nest 
since Tigerheart had arrived. Marigold 
listened, her gaze distant and dull. Boots 
stopped talking and began gently lapping 
her head, working his way along her 
spine with gentle strokes. 

Tigerheart guessed that the old cat 
was dying. He was glad she had the care 
and protection of the guardian cats. For a 
moment he wondered how often strays 


must die alone, in a chilly makeshift den, 
with no help for their pain. The thought 
stung him, and he pushed it away. He 
wasn’t a stray; he never would be. And 
he’d make sure his kits never became 
strays either. 

He stood up and stepped from the 
nest, turning back to tuck a few pelts 
around Dovewing so she didn’t feel the 
chill of his absence. He padded into a 
stream of early-morning light and began 
to wash. The sound of his tongue rasping 
over his fur was loud in the silent 
cavern. Boots lifted his head and blinked 
at him, then returned to washing 
Marigold. 

Fur swished nearby, and Tigerheart 


turned to see Spire creeping from his 
nest. The skinny black tom glanced back 
at Blaze, still sleeping among the furless 
pelts, then tiptoed across the cavern 
floor and leaped onto the ledge that led 
to the entrance. 

Quiet as a mouse, the tom slid out the 
gap into the pale morning. 

Why had he left Blaze? Spire 
normally took the kit everywhere with 
him. What was he up to? Curious, 
Tigerheart hopped onto the wooden 
ledge, waited until Spire had slipped out 
of sight, and then leaped up and 
squeezed through the gap in the wall. 
Stone dust trickled into his fur, and he 
shook it free as he padded out of the 


shadow of the gathering place. The leaf- 
fall sunshine was bright, the air cold, 
and a blue sky arced above. The lines of 
stone slabs, sitting upright in the dewy 
grass, striped the clearing with shadow. 
Tigerheart saw a shape move between 
them. Spire was weaving his way 
toward a tall chestnut tree at the edge of 
the clearing. A Thunderpath lay beside 
it, monsters rumbling sedately past. 
Tigerheart had grown so used to them, he 
hardly noticed. His gaze was following 
Spire. 

Tigerheart lingered behind a stone 
slab and watched as Spire reached the 
chestnut tree. The tom sat down and 
stared across the stretch of grass, which 


was divided by a smooth stone path that 
led to what Tigerheart guessed was the 
Twoleg entrance to the gathering place. 
Was Spire waiting for something? 
Tigerheart padded closer, his pelt 
tingling with curiosity. Keeping quiet, he 
stopped behind the stone slab nearest the 
chestnut tree and, hidden from view, 
watched to see what Spire would do 
next. 

“Is this what warriors do?” Spire 
asked pointedly. 

Tigerheart stiffened, confused for a 
moment—he hadn’t expected to hear the 
word warrior from one of the guardian 
cats, though it didn’t sound quite so 
strange out of Spire’s mouth. But he had 


been sure that he hadn’t been seen or 
heard as he approached. 

“I came outside to get a chance to 
think,” Spire went on. 

Tigerheart padded sheepishly from 
his hiding place and dipped his head to 
the skinny black tom. “I wondered why 
you'd left Blaze,” he mumbled. “You 
usually take him everywhere.” 

“He usually follows me 
everywhere,” Spire answered tartly. 
“But even a crazy cat likes me needs 
solitude once in a while.” 

“Tm sorry.” Tigerheart backed away. 
“PII leave you alone.” 

As he spoke, a monster drew up at 
the end of the smooth stone path, and a 


brightly pelted Twoleg got out and began 
to walk toward the gathering place. 
Tigerheart froze and waited as the 
Twoleg disappeared inside. 

“The entrance is open,” Tigerheart 
mewed in surprise. The wooden slabs 
that usually barred the entrance to the 
gathering place stood open. “Will they 
find the cavern?” 

“They won’t even look for it,” Spire 
told him matter-of-factly. “Its their 
yowling time. They do it every quarter 
moon, and in the evenings sometimes 
too.” 

Another monster pulled up and 
stopped at the edge of the Thunderpath. 
Several Twolegs climbed out and 


headed toward the gathering-place 
entrance. 

Tigerheart hesitated. He knew Spire 
wanted to be alone, but he wanted to 
know what yowling time was. He’d 
leave soon, but for now he’d watch. 
Another group of Twolegs were heading 
up the smooth stone path toward the 
wooden entrance. Soon more were 
flocking toward the thorn den, and 
Tigerheart glanced guiltily at Spire, 
whose gaze hadn’t shifted from the 
Twolegs. “I should go.” Reluctantly, he 
turned toward the cavern. 

“Stay and listen if you want.” Spire 
shifted his paws. 

“But you wanted to be alone,” 


Tigerheart reminded him. 

“Being pestered by a kit is not the 
same as sitting with a warrior.” Spire 
didn’t look at him. He was absently 
watching more Twolegs arrive. He must 
have watched it many times before. 

Tigerheart padded to the tom’s side 
and sat beside him. 

“I like having Blaze around,” Spire 
meowed suddenly, as though he felt he 
had to explain. “But kits ask lots of 
questions, and this morning I need to 
think.” 

Tigerheart remembered with a pang 
how Grassheart’s kits had asked 
questions relentlessly, and had wanted to 
play when Grassheart longed to doze 


quietly in the sunshine. The apprentices 
had kept them busy, teaching them games 
and hunting moves, and the elders had 
joined in, giving Grassheart a chance to 
rest. Would his kits ask questions? How 
would he and Dovewing cope without 
Clanmates to help them? 

“I had a dream.” Spire interrupted 
his thoughts. “I saw a tree fall... .” The 
tom’s eyes had glazed; his mew had 
drifted into thoughtfulness. “It cut 
through a shadow as black as night.” 

A shadow? Tigerheart stiffened. 
Spire might not be a medicine cat, and 
they were far beyond the reach of 
StarClan—but there was something 
about the way that he described his 


dream that made Tigerheart feel it might 
be significant. 

“Where it cut through,’ Spire 
continued, “I could see beyond.” 

Tigerheart’s pelt prickled with 
foreboding. “What could you see?” 

Spire looked at him, his gaze 
clearing suddenly as though waking from 
a trance. “Light.” 

Tigerheart’s thoughts spun in a way 
they hadn’t since he’d left ShadowClan. 
He’d thought he was free of omens and 
worry. But now, this cat, who had never 
even heard of StarClan, was talking of 
dreams like a real medicine cat. His 
dream sounded like one Puddleshine 
might have had. And it was about 


shadows. Always shadows! Tigerheart 
shivered. “The tree.” He stared at Spire. 
“The one that sliced through the 
shadow ... What sort was it?” Could it 
represent Rowanstar? 

Spire shrugged. “It was a tree. A tall 
one. An old one.” 

“Was it a rowan tree?” 

“I don’t know,” Spire told him. “A 
tree is a tree.” 

“But it’s important!” Was his father 
going to destroy ShadowClan like the 
tree in Spire’s dream? Or would he cut 
through the shadows that threatened to 
swallow the Clan and find a way to light 
beyond? “How did you feel when you 
saw the tree cut the shadow? Were you 


scared?” Tigerheart leaned closer. “Or 
did you feel hope?” 

“I didn’t feel anything, apart from 
curiosity.” Spire looked at him blankly. 
“Why? Does the dream mean something 
to you?” 

Tigerheart looked away. “I don’t 
know.” He stared at the ground. Spire 
wasn’t a Clan cat. How could his dream 
have anything to do with ShadowClan? 
“You dream a lot, right?” 

“Yes.” Spire curled his tail over his 
paws and looked back toward the 
Twolegs streaming into the gathering 
place. “Sometimes when I’m awake.” 

Tigerheart forced his fur to smooth. 
Maybe they aren't real visions, he told 


himself Maybe Spire just has... a 
good imagination. 

The gathering place began to hum 
with Twoleg murmuring. Then the noise 
swelled suddenly, and the murmurings 
joined into one voice that yowled in a 
way Tigerheart had never heard before. 
Their yowling lifted and fell, hardened 
and softened, like the song of a bird in 
greenleaf. Tigerheart stared at the great 
den. The huge thorn jutting from its roof 
sparkled against the cloudless sky as the 
Twolegs wailed inside. 

Spire blinked at him. “Let’s go back 
into the cavern,” he meowed. “The 
yowling sounds more interesting from 
down there.” 


Tigerheart’s ears twitched. He 
hurried after Spire as the tom headed 
toward the gap in the wall. Dovewing 
would wonder where he’d gone. 

I’m coming. He broke into a run. 
Dovewing needed him. That’s why he’d 
come here. Forget about ShadowClan. 
Why had he let Spire’s dream spook 
him? But what if StarClan is trying to 
reach me? He pushed away the nagging 
doubt. ShadowClan had Rowanstar. /’m 
needed here now, not there. 

He nosed through the gap ahead of 
Spire and jumped down to the wooden 
ledge. Dovewing was awake, sitting in a 
pool of sunshine, watching Blaze and 
Ant play fight. 


“Am I doing it right?” Blaze looked 
eagerly at Dovewing as he wrapped 
himself around Ant’s forepaw and began 
churning his leg with his hind paws. 

“Youre doing great!” Dovewing 
purred. 

Spire landed on the ledge beside 
Tigerheart, and Blaze’s gaze flashed 
toward them. 

“You're back!” He released Ant’s 
leg and rushed to meet Spire as the black 
tom jumped down from the ledge. “Did 
you go to watch the Twolegs yowling?” 

Spire had been right. The cavern 
throbbed with the noise above. 
Tigerheart caught Dovewing’s eye and 
blinked at her affectionately. He 


followed Spire down from the ledge and 
crossed the floor to meet her. “The noise 
is really something.” 

Ant, sitting where Blaze had left him, 
lifted his head. “The first time I heard it, 
I thought dogs were howling upstairs.” 

“Tt does sound like that,” Dovewing 
mewed. “Isn’t it strange?” 

Tigerheart’s fur brushed hers as he 
sat down beside her. “Twolegs are 
weird.” 

“Where did you go?” she asked him 
softly. 

Before he could answer, Ant 
stretched. “Thanks for the fighting tips. 
I'm going to hunt.” He nodded to 
Tigerheart. “Do you want to come?” 


“Maybe later,” Tigerheart told him. 
He wanted to speak with Dovewing 
first. Spire’s dream had shaken him. 

Ant flicked his tail. “Okay.” 

As the brown-and-black tom headed 
toward the cavern entrance, Tigerheart 
leaned closer to Dovewing. “I followed 
Spire,” he told her. “He told me he’d 
had a dream.” 

Dovewing shifted her paws as 
though easing her swollen belly into a 
more comfortable position. “Fierce says 
he dreams all the time.” 

“I know,” ‘Tigerheart mewed, 
frowning. “He said that sometimes he 
even dreams when he’s awake.” Worry 
was tugging in his belly. “The way he 


talked about it, it seemed a lot like a 
dream Puddleshine might have.” 

“How?” Dovewing blinked at him, 
concern glittering in her green eyes. 

“He dreamed about a shadow and a 
falling tree. The tree cut through the 
shadow, and he could see light beyond.” 

Dovewing flicked her tail 
impatiently. “I suppose you think that has 
something to do with ShadowClan.” 

“Perhaps it does.” 

“Why? Spire’s not a medicine cat. 
And these cats all live so far away from 
the Clans, they had no idea we even 
existed. Why would StarClan speak to 

“Perhaps because they want to reach 


me here.” 

Dovewing rolled her eyes. “Because 
you're so important to ShadowClan.” 

Anger sparked in Tigerheart’s pelt. 
“I am important to ShadowClan. I’m 
their deputy, remember?” 

“You were their deputy,’ she 
reminded him. “But you gave all that up 
to be here with me.” 

Not forever. He searched 
Dovewing’s gaze. Did she really think 
they would never go home? 

She blinked back at him, doubt 
furrowing her brow. “You did give it up, 
didn’t you?” 

Guilt jabbed Tigerheart’s belly. “I 
wanted to find you... .” 


Her green eyes blazed angrily. “So 
you could bring me back?” 

“No!” he yelped. “Well, yes... I 
don’t know, exactly! I just knew that I 
wanted to be with you.” His head 
drooped as he kneaded the ground in 
confusion. 

“You can be with me here.” 

Tigerheart felt like a huge paw was 
pushing down on his head. He couldn’t 
bear to look up at her, because he feared 
what he would see in her eyes. 
Disappointment? Betrayal? 

“Tigerheart?” She was searching his 
gaze now, fear sparking in her eyes. 
“You gave up ShadowClan to be here 
with me, right?” 


Grief swept through him like a storm 
tearing through forest. “I... I guess I 
didn’t know it might be forever,” he 
meowed helplessly. 

“And now because some cat has a 
dream,” she hissed, “you want to go 
back? I seem to remember it was not so 
long ago that you weren’t taking dreams 
quite so seriously.” 

Tigerheart felt a pang of guilt, but 
stood up straight and looked at her. “Do 
you really believe we can stay away 
from our Clans forever? Can you really 
raise our kits here? They’ll never know 
what it’s like to have Clanmates, or to 
have a mentor, or to be willing to fight 
for their territory.” He stared at her. 


“You want to raise our kits as strays?” 

Pain flashed suddenly across 
Dovewing’s face. 

Tigerheart’s breath caught in his 
throat. “I’m sorry,” he yowled, pressing 
himself against her. “I didn’t mean to be 
so harsh. .. .” 

Dovewing gasped and staggered. 
“Its not that, you mouse-brain!” 

Panic flashed in her eyes. She shot 
him a desperate look as she dropped into 
a crouch. Heart pounding in his ears, he 
scanned the den for a healer. 

Fierce was already crossing the 
floor toward them. She flicked her tail 
toward Spire. “Dovewing needs help.” 

Spire hurried to join her. 


“Whats wrong with her?” Tigerheart 
wailed as they reached him. 

Dovewing panted beside him. “The 
kits are coming.” 

Terrified, Tigerheart turned to Spire. 
“Is it time?” 

Spire blinked at him calmly. “I think 
that your kits have decided it is.” 





CHAPTER 18 
Cog 


Fierce guided Tigerheart away as Spire 
helped Dovewing to her nest. 

“She needs me.” Tigerheart looked 
at her, contorted with pain as she 
slumped among the furless pelts. 

“The healers will take care of her.” 
Fierce nodded to Peanut, who was 
already hurrying toward the sound of 
Dovewing’s wailing. “Peanut’s had kits 
of her own, and she’s helped cats in their 
kitting before.” She blinked gently at 
Tigerheart. “We get a lot of queens 
through here. Spire and Peanut know 
what they’re doing.” 


“T want to be with her.” Tigerheart’s 
chest was so tight he could hardly find 
his breath. 

“First you need to calm down.” 
Fierce fixed her gaze on his, her eyes 
shimmering. “I know it’s your first litter, 
but it will be okay.” 

“It’s my fault she started kitting.” 
Guilt surged beneath his pelt. “I upset 
her.” 

“If a queen started kitting every time 
some cat upset them, there’d be a lot of 
unexpected deliveries,” Fierce soothed. 

“I shouldn’t have said anything.” 
Tigerheart’s thoughts whirled. Why in 
StarClan had he mentioned 
Puddleshine’s dream? Dovewing 


already had so much to worry about right 
now. 

“Tigerheart!” Dovewing’s cry cut 
into his thoughts. 

He jerked his muzzle toward her. 
She was glaring at him, pain glittering in 
her fierce gaze. “Stop sitting there like a 
rabbit and do something useful!” She 
gasped as Peanut leaned into the nest and 
stroked her belly with a paw. 

Tigerheart stared in panic. “What 
can I do?” 

“Fetch me a stick to bite on,” 
Dovewing panted. “I don’t want these 
cats to hear me squealing like a kit!” 

Tigerheart nodded and hurried to the 
gap in the wall. He scrambled outside, 


then raced to the tall chestnut tree he’d 
sat under with Spire. The Twolegs were 
still yowling inside. A monster rumbled 
past. White clouds dotted the sky. 
Tigerheart scanned the grass, spotting a 
sturdy stick lying beneath the tree. He 
bent down and bit it, relieved to feel it 
firm between his jaws. No bark 
splintered from the smooth stem. It 
would be perfect for Dovewing. Quickly 
he carried it back to the cavern, 
struggling to maneuver it into the gap. He 
pushed it through, end first, and it fell 
onto the ledge and bounced on the floor. 
Fierce and Rascal turned to watch it 
tumble to a halt. Blaze hurried across the 
cavern and stood beside it. “What’s this 


for?” he asked as Tigerheart landed next 
to it. 

“Its for Dovewing.” Tigerheart 
snatched it up and carried it toward 
Dovewing’s nest. 

“What does she need a stick for?” 
Blaze followed him. 

“To bite on.” Tigerheart struggled to 
speak through the stick. He dropped it 
beside the nest. “It will help with the 
pain.” 

Blaze stopped beside him and stared 
at Dovewing. Peanut had climbed into 
the nest and was soothing her with gentle 
laps behind her ears. Spire leaned in and 
ran his paws over her belly. Dovewing 
convulsed, a spasm jerking her body. 


“Why do cats have kits?” Blaze asked. 

Spire turned from Dovewing and met 
the tom-kit’s gaze. “Blaze,” he meowed 
softly. “Dovewing will need water. Find 
a rag and soak it under the drip-pipe. 
Then bring it here. But wait until it’s 
dripping wet before you bring it back.” 

Blaze nodded earnestly, then hurried 
away. 

Tigerheart stared at Dovewing as 
another spasm gripped her. “Is she 
okay?” 

Dovewing shot him a look. ““Where’s 
the stick?” she growled between gritted 
teeth. 

He pushed it hurriedly into the nest 
and she clamped her jaws around it and 


groaned as another spasm made her 
stiffen. She shuddered, then jerked. 

Spire broke into a purr as a small, 
wet sac slid into the nest behind her. 
Quickly he nipped the sac’s membrane 
with his teeth and peeled the bundle of 
slick fur from inside. He placed it 
beside Dovewing’s cheek. “Meet your 
firstborn.” 

Dovewing let go of the stick and, 
purring loudly, lapped at the tiny kit as it 
squirmed and mewled beside her. 

“You have a daughter.” Spire blinked 
at Tigerheart happily. 

Tigerheart stared at the kit, hardly 
able to believe his eyes. This small 
scrap of fur was what all the heartache 


and worry of the past two moons had 
been about. His heart seemed to swell 
until joy burst from his throat in a purr. 
“She’s beautiful.” How could he have 
ever doubted that he should be here with 
Dovewing? He thrust his muzzle close to 
hers, nuzzling first the kit and then her 
cheek. 

She purred too, their gaze meeting as 
she turned her head to press her nose 
against his. “She’s so soft and—” A 
spasm cut her off. She nudged Tigerheart 
away, tucked the kit close to her chest, 
and clamped her teeth around the stick 
once more. Jerking, she groaned, and 
another kit dropped into the nest. 

“A son,” Spire mewed happily, 


placing the soggy bundle beside the first. 

Tigerheart watched as Dovewing bit 
down once more on the stick. 

“Another daughter.” Spire placed a 
third kit beside the others. He ran his 
paw over Dovewing’s belly. “That’s the 
whole litter.” He sat back on his 
haunches and looked at Peanut. 

Peanut purred. “It’s always good to 
help with kitting after taking care of so 
many sick and wounded cats.” Her gaze 
wandered to Marigold’s nest, which was 
empty. 

Tigerheart looked at it. Boots, the 
one-eyed cat, was dragging the bundle of 
furless pelts apart and shaking them out 
with his teeth. ““Where’s Marigold?” 


Spire nudged Tigerheart away and 
lowered his voice. “She died last night,” 
he whispered. “She’s free from her 
suffering now.” 

Tigerheart began to feel a felt a pang 
of sadness, but Peanut’s mew distracted 
him. 

“You did well.” Peanut dipped her 
head to Dovewing. As Tigerheart 
hurried back to the nest side, the 
tortoiseshell padded away. 

Spire followed her, and Tigerheart 
was suddenly very aware that he was 
alone with Dovewing and their three 
newborn kits. His fur prickled uneasily. 
What was he supposed to do now? 
Dovewing lapped the kits until their wet 


fur fluffed out; then she nosed them 
toward her belly, where they nuzzled 
until they found milk. Dovewing purred 
and curled around them. She seemed to 
know what to do instinctively. So did the 
kits. Tigerheart’s belly tightened as the 
huge responsibility of taking care of 
them gripped him. The freedom he’d felt 
since leaving ShadowClan seemed to 
evaporate like morning mist. Suddenly 
all the ties that had once held him were 
binding him again. He had left his Clan, 
but it had traveled with him. These kits 
were his to protect and to raise. They 
were as much a part of him as 
ShadowClan, and he was part of them. 
Dovewing looked at him, her eyes 


sleepy and filled with love. “Aren’t they 
perfect?” 

“Yes.” Tigerheart crouched 
awkwardly beside the nest and stretched 
his muzzle in to sniff them. In the shadow 
beneath the ledge, he could see their 
colors now. One she-kit was gray, like 
Dovewing, the other tabby like him, and 
the tom-kit was a gray tabby, with wide 
dark stripes along his flanks. They 
smelled warm and sweet. The ton-kit 
mewled indignantly as Tigerheart lapped 
his rabbit-soft fur, and pressed closer to 
Dovewing’s belly. “I don’t think he likes 
me,” Tigerheart murmured anxiously. 

“Of course he does. You're his 
father.” Dovewing touched a paw to 


Tigerheart’s cheek, and the tenderness in 
her touch made him feel guilty all over 
again about their argument. 

“Tm sorry,” he murmured. “Perhaps 
I shouldn’t have told you about 
Puddleshine’s dream. But I couldn’t lie 
to you. You have to believe that you are 
the most important thing in my life, but 
without my loyalty to my Clan, what 
would I be?” 

She gazed at him softly. “I know. 
Your loyalty makes you who you are. 
And I know you will love our kits with 
the same fierce loyalty with which you 
love your Clan. I love you, Tigerheart. I 
would have loved you even if you hadn’t 
followed me here. I will always love 


9 


you.” She paused, her green eyes 
shining. “Not just because you're the 
father of my kits, but because you’re 
you. Pm sorry I made you choose 
between your Clan and me. No cat 
should ever have to make that choice. I 
was scared of facing this alone. I’ve 
been a coward.” 

“No!” He licked her cheek fiercely, 
his heart bursting with pride. “You’ve 
been brave. So very brave. And I would 
have loved you too, even if my Clan had 
kept me from you. Nothing could stop the 
way I feel about you.” 

She returned his gaze steadily. “We 
will always love each other. But we 
have a responsibility to our Clans and to 


our kits. We are warriors—” 

Tigerheart cut in: “And our kits will 
be warriors too.” 

Dovewing nodded. “They will be 
raised in a Clan.” 

Tigerheart searched Dovewing’s 
gaze, relieved to find agreement shining 
in their green depths. “Yes,” he purred. 

Dovewing purred too and then 
added, “But first they must be weaned 
and grow strong enough to travel.” 

“They’re not going into the belly of a 
Thundersnake,” Tigerheart meowed 
firmly. 

“No.” Dovewing gave a mrrow of 
amusement. “Thundersnakes can fill 
their bellies with Twolegs. Our kits will 


walk.” 

Tigerheart saw tiredness in her eyes. 
“You must be exhausted. Sleep now and 
I will keep watch.” 

Dovewing blinked at him gratefully, 
then cast her gaze across the cavern. The 
guardian cats sat in groups, sharing prey. 
Mittens was leading Pipsqueak and 
Blaze out through the entrance. Fierce 
dozed in a strip of sunshine. “There’s no 
need to keep watch,’ she mewed 
sleepily. “They'll keep watch for us.” 
She closed her eyes and let her chin rest 
on her paws. The kits had grown still 
and were purring softly. 

Tigerheart rested his head on the 
side of the nest, contentment enfolding 


him like a warm breeze. As he watched 
Dovewing sleep, he heard paw steps 
behind him. He lifted his head and 
looked around. 

Spire was padding toward him. The 
clear, bright gaze he’d had while he’d 
helped with Dovewing’s kitting had 
given way to the glazed look Tigerheart 
had seen in the tom’s yellow eyes when 
they first met. Was he having one of his 
visions? 

Tigerheart sat up, blocking the way 
to his kits. “Spire? Are you okay?” 

Spire peered past him, staring 
directly at the dark gray tom-kit. His fur 
ruffled along his spine. “This one will 
see into the shadows.” 


Tigerheart tensed. “What do you 
mean?” 

Spire looked at him vacantly, then 
padded away. 

Tigerheart shook out his fur, irritated 
by the uneasy feeling Spire had awoken 
beneath his pelt. Don t be silly. He’ not 
a medicine cat. He stared after Spire. 
But why did he speak of shadows 
again? Did this tom have some strange 
connection with ShadowClan? Was 
StarClan speaking through him? 

Tigerheart shifted his paws 
nervously. He glanced up at the flat 
white roof, wondering if StarClan could 
see them here. We’ll come home as soon 
as we can, he promised. Turning to gaze 


once more at Dovewing and their kits, he 
leaned down and breathed in their scent. 
His heart ached with love, and he settled 
beside the nest and closed his eyes. 





CHAPTER 19 
Cog 


Hurry up. Tigerheart glanced down the 
alley to where Cobweb, Mittens, and 
Fierce had stopped to drink from a 
puddle. It was bad enough they had to 
scavenge for scraps even Twolegs didn’t 
want; did they have to take so long? 
There were no mouthwatering prey 
scents carried on fresh forest breezes 
here. Tigerheart wanted to get the patrol 
over with. 

The laid-back life of the guardian 
cats no longer felt like a relief. It had 
begun to irritate him. Scavenging was all 
they did now. In the two moons since 


Shadowkit, Pouncekit, and Lightkit had 
been born, leaf-fall had hardened into 
leaf-bare. Prey had become scarce, and 
the guardian cats relied on Twoleg 
scraps more and more. This morning, 
Tigerheart had woken to a hard frost, 
which had turned the clear walls of the 
gathering-place den into patterned ice. 
And yet when he’d followed the others 
out into the streets, the city lacked the 
stone-cold chill of the forest, holding a 
warmth of its own like a huge living 
creature. 

Fierce had suggested they take a tour 
of their favorite scrapcans, clustered in 
the alleys that ran behind the rows of 
dens. Tigerheart had offered to come, as 


he always did. He owed the guardian 
cats his loyalty. But he secretly hoped 
that he would find a mouse or bird to 
take home to Lightkit, Pouncekit, and 
Shadowkit. Weaned now, they were 
eager for food, and Tigerheart hated that 
they had only tasted Twoleg scraps. 
What if they didn’t grow up to be strong? 
City strays were agile and wily, but none 
of them were as well-muscled as a 
forest cat. He’d hunted around the 
gathering place, but in the city there was 
always the sudden rumble of a monster 
or the thumping paws of a passing 
Twoleg to scare prey before he could 
finish stalking it. He hadn’t caught 
anything for half a moon. He guessed that 


was why the guardian cats weren’t even 
trying to hunt now. Besides, the 
scrapcans were overflowing, even as the 
weather grew harsher. He remembered 
with a pang the anxious days of leaf-bare 
in the forest, when catching a single 
rabbit brought joy to the whole Clan 
because it meant a warm night’s sleep on 
a full belly. 

These cats have no idea what it is 
to go hungry, Tigerheart thought as he 
watched Cobweb shake puddle water 
from his whiskers and Fierce lap a few 
more sour mouthfuls. He wondered if 
they had ever been truly cold. The 
gathering-place den had grown chilly, 
but it was sheltered from wind and free 


of the drafts that would be slicing 
through gaps in the walls and dens of the 
ShadowClan camp now. It was easy to 
warm up in the furless-pelt nests. 

In the past two moons, he’d learned 
city words like alley, street, and 
scrapcan; he’d grown accustomed to 
monsters and had learned to dart 
between them with ease as they crawled 
between the dens. He hardly noticed the 
Twolegs now as he wove between their 
legs on patrol. 

This was the only world his kits 
knew. They’d never seen forests and 
streams and real prey. He wondered 
how long it would be before Dovewing 
agreed that they were old enough to 


make the journey home. By the time they 
reached the lake, would they be able to 
adjust to warrior life? 

His pelt ruffled uneasily at the 
thought and he pushed it away. There 
would be plenty of time for them to learn 
to become warriors. But what if this first 
glimpse of life stayed with them? What 
if they always found warrior ways 
strange? 

“Tm going on hunting patrol,” he’d 
told Pouncekit before he’d left. 

She’d blinked at him. “Don’t you 
mean scavenging?” she’d asked. “That’s 
what the others call it.” 

“Scavenging is like hunting,” 
Dovewing had answered quickly as 


Tigerheart’s pelt ruffled, then added, 
“Tigerheart used to be the best hunter in 
ShadowClan.” 

Pouncekit didn’t seem to hear. “Why 
don’t warriors scavenge like city cats?” 

Tigerheart stared at her. What could 
he say? That warriors had more pride 
and more skill? That they kept their 
distance from Twolegs, and definitely 
didn’t eat their scraps? He didn’t want 
to insult the guardian cats. But he wanted 
Pouncekit to understand what it meant to 
be a warrior. 

Dovewing spoke for him again. 
“There aren’t any scrapcans to scavenge 
from by the lake,” she told Pouncekit 
diplomatically. She caught Tigerheart’s 


eye. “Besides, hunting is much more fun 
than scavenging. You'll find out when 
you become a warrior.” 

Tigerheart had turned away heavily 
and followed Fierce, © Cobweb, 
Cinnamon, and Mittens out of the 
gathering place. He hoped that soon he’d 
be able to show Pouncekit what a 
warrior was. Now, as the sun lifted over 
the Twoleg dens, Tigerheart glanced at 
the bright blue sky showing between the 
rooftops. They’d scavenged all morning, 
but he hadn’t once smelled prey, and his 
hope of finding fresh-kill for the kits was 
fading. 

Fierce flicked her tail happily. “Cold 
weather like this makes Twolegs 


hungry,” she meowed. “Which means 
more leftovers for us.” She led the way 
to another cluster of scrapcans and 
jumped onto one. As she knocked it open 
with practiced ease, Tigerheart jumped 
onto the next and pushed away its cover 
while Cobweb and Mittens rummaged 
through litter at their base. Tigerheart 
dug deep into the trash, his paws feeling 
the softness of something edible. He 
hooked it out with his claws. A round 
lump of something that smelled a little 
like meat but he knew would taste sour. 

Cobweb glanced at it, his eyes 
brightening. “Meat scraps!” 

Mittens hooked out a soft white strip 
from among the litter. “Dotty will like 


this,” he mewed. “It’s easy to chew.” 

Fierce pulled a bone from her trash 
and flicked it triumphantly onto the 
ground below. “There’s more in here.” 
She delved deeper and hauled out 
another. 

Tigerheart swallowed back distaste 
as she tossed it over the side. Warriors 
leave bones for the crows. Here they 
were a treat. 

Fierce jumped down. “Let’s take 
these scraps back to Cinnamon.” 

They’d left Cinnamon guarding their 
first haul—a collection of scraps they’d 
fished out of a scrapcan nearer the 
gathering place. Tigerheart had 
suggested a moon ago that the guardian 


patrols stash the scraps they’d gathered 
before taking them home. It was an old 
warrior trick that freed up their paws for 
more scavenging. But the city was full of 
cats and foxes, and they’d often return to 
find that their stash had been raided. It 
had been Cinnamon’s idea to post a 
guard. Tigerheart had been pleased that 
one of the guardian cats had begun to 
think like a warrior. 

He hurried back toward Cinnamon. 
The strange meat he’d scavenged 
dangled from his jaws and smeared 
grease on his chin. As he ducked from 
the alley and followed the street that led 
to their stash place, pigeons fluttered 
between the dens above him. If only he 


could reach one. Why hadn’t the 
guardian cats come up with a plan to 
catch them? There must be some place in 
the city where the clumsy birds settled 
within reach. Hadn’t the guardian cats 
worked out where it was? 

As he turned in to the narrow alley 
between dens where they'd left 
Cinnamon, his fur bristled. Four strays 
surrounded her. They’d backed her 
against the wall where her stash was 
piled. Cinnamon spat at them, back 
arched and fur bushed. One of the strays 
reached for a scrap trailing from the pile 
behind her. Cinnamon lashed out with a 
hiss. The tom backed away, snarling. Fur 
sparking with alarm, Tigerheart dropped 


the meat he’d been carrying and leaped 
in front of Cinnamon. 

He faced the strays and growled at 
them menacingly. “This is our stash,” he 
snarled. “Go find your own.” 

As he spoke, Fierce padded into the 
alley. Cobweb and Mittens watched, 
wide-eyed, from the end. Tigerheart 
beckoned them closer. He might need 
backup. The strays were standing their 
ground. Greed shone in their eyes. 

One of them—a lithe gray she-cat— 
narrowed her bright blue gaze. “Your 
friend wanted to share,” she told 
Tigerheart. 

“No, she didnt,’ Tigerheart 
snapped. 


The gray cat glanced around at the 
guardian cats, food dangling from their 
jaws, then nodded to the scraps piled 
behind Cinnamon. “There’s enough to 
share.” 

Tigerheart growled. “We have other 
mouths to feed.” 

“We might have other mouths to feed 
too.” The gray she-cat tipped her head. 

“That doesn’t mean you can take our 
catch.” Tigerheart glanced at Fierce. 
Was she going to speak up? 

“Why shouldn’t we?” the gray cat 
meowed. 

“You didn’t catch it,’ Tigerheart 
growled. 

“Nor did you.” The she-cat glanced 


dismissively at the scraps. “You found it. 
Now we ’re finding it too.” 

Shame scorched beneath Tigerheart’s 
pelt. She was right. They’d picked these 
scraps out of cans. I’m fighting over 
crow-food! And yet this crow-food 
would feed the cats waiting at the 
gathering place. Jt will feed my kits. He 
lifted his chin. Even if it wasn’t prey, it 
would keep them from starving. A new, 
protective anger surged in his chest. /t 
belongs to us! Did this cat have no sense 
of honor at all? He looked around at the 
guardian cats, who were watching 
uneasily. “You're trying to steal from my 
friend,” he hissed slowly. 

“Steal!” The gray cat lifted her chin. 


“No cat owns anything until it’s safely in 
her belly. Here it’s every cat for herself. 
You’re obviously not city-born, or you’d 
know that.” 

“Pm glad I’m not city-born.” But my 
kits are. Tigerheart pushed the thought 
away. “I was born in a place where we 
feed our Clan before we feed 
ourselves.” 

The gray cat shrugged. “But you'd let 
us go hungry?” 

Tigerheart blinked. How was she 
making him out to be the bad cat? 
“You’re not my Clanmate. Besides, there 
are plenty of scrapcans in the city. You 
won’t go hungry.” 

“Plenty of scrapcans,’” the she-cat 


mimicked. “But only if we can get to 
them before the foxes.” 

“Foxes only come out at night, when 
the Twolegs have gone,” Tigerheart 
pointed out. 

“What do you know, outsider?” For 
the first time, the she-cat’s eyes rounded, 
betraying unease. Pelt ruffled, she 
nodded to her companions. “Come on. 
Lets try somewhere else.” She shot 
Tigerheart a look. “Don’t get too 
comfortable. You don’t belong here. I 
can still smell the grass on your paws.” 
Turning her tail on him, she padded 
away down the alley. The others 
followed, glancing reproachfully over 
their shoulders. 


“Well done.” Fierce blinked at 
Tigerheart warmly. 

“You saved us a fight.” Cinnamon 
looked relieved. 

For now. Tigerheart watched the city 
cats disappear around the corner. Don t 
get too comfortable. The gray cat’s 
parting threat made him feel this 
confrontation might just be the beginning. 


Back at the gathering-place den, the 
guardian cats clustered around the patrol 
as they dropped the scraps they'd 
collected. Tigerheart eased himself 
away from the crowd and glanced 
toward his nest. He was relieved to see 
that Dovewing and the kits were 
sleeping. 


“Those smell like good scraps.” 

Spire’s mew took him by surprise. 

The skinny black tom was sitting in 
the shadow of a wooden ledge, watching 
Blaze scramble for food with the others. 
Tigerheart had avoided Spire as much as 
possible since the strange healer cat had 
told him Shadowkit would be able to see 
into the shadows. He hadn’t told 
Dovewing of Spire’s prediction, even 
after she’d named the  tonrkit. 
“Shadowkit, in honor of your Clan,” she 
had explained. How could he have 
argued with her? The coincidence had 
unnerved him, though, and he’d kept 
clear of Spire in case the tom announced 
any more alarming visions. 


Now Spire watched the guardian 
cats with a clear, even gaze. “How are 
your kits?” 

“Fine,” Tigerheart answered quickly. 
“I was thinking of catching some real 
food for them.” 

“Food is food,” Spire mewed 
casually. 

“Scraps arent warrior food.” 
They’re crow-food. Tigerheart didn’t 
meet the healer’s gaze. “Warriors eat 
fresh-kill.” 

“And your kits will be warriors.” 
The healer’s tone was matter-of-fact. 

Tigerheart felt Spire’s gaze burning 
into his pelt. Unable to resist, he turned 
to meet it. Did this strange cat know for 


sure that his kits would be warriors? Or 
am I just taking him seriously because 
he’s saying something I want to hear? 

He gave the tom a questioning look. 

“What else could they be with 
Dovewing and you as their parents?” 
Spire got to his paws and padded 
toward Blaze. 

Blaze met him, greasy scraps 
hanging from his mouth. The young tom’s 
eyes shone brightly as he dropped them 
at Spire’s paws. “Look what I got for 
us!” 

Tigerheart looked up at the den 
entrance. Determination hardened his 
belly. He would catch fresh-kill for his 
kits. Was there time before they woke? 


Quickly he leaped onto the wooden 
ledge and up through the gap in the wall. 

Outside, pigeons fluttered around the 
great spike sticking up from the thorn 
den. Hope pricked in Tigerheart’s paws 
as one swooped low, but a passing 
monster sent it rushing upward once 
more, and his heart sank as it nestled 
beside its companions on the roof. 

Pelt itching with frustration, he 
stalked between the stone slabs. The 
frost on the grass had melted, and icy 
water seeped into his paws. This grassy 
stretch around the gathering den was the 
only green he’d seen since arriving in 
the city. His heart ached for the crunch of 
pine needles beneath his paws. He 


longed for the scent of sap and the 
familiar smells of home. Had Rowanstar 
chased the shadows away yet? Was 
ShadowClan back to normal? Was it safe 
for him to return without blocking the 
sun? Even if it was, he knew the kits 
were too young for such a journey. 

A loud chirrup sounded nearby. 
Tigerheart jerked his muzzle toward it. A 
thrush was hopping along the branch of a 
cherry tree. The colored walls of the 
gathering place glittered behind it. 

Tigerheart sank into the grass. 
Dampness soaked his belly fur as he 
fixed his gaze on the thrush. Keeping as 
still as one of the stone slabs, he waited. 
The thrush chirped again. A warning 


cry? Had it spotted him? Tigerheart’s 
chest tightened. He glanced at the trunk, 
wondering if he could climb without 
being seen. But the branches had been 
stripped bare by the cold. The thrush 
would see any movement. 

Frustrated, Tigerheart flexed his 
claws, longing for the shadows of the 
pine forest. Feeling helpless, he watched 
the thrush flutter onto a higher branch. It 
pecked at the bark, then hopped to a spot 
of moss farther along and began pecking 
again. 

Disappointment dropped in 
Tigerheart’s belly like a stone. There 
was no way to reach the thrush without 
scaring it off. His kits would eat crow- 


food again today. Guilt tugged him 
toward his nest. If they woke, he wanted 
to be there to share crow-food with them 
at least. As they ate, he could reassure 
them that one day they’d eat real prey. 
Movement jerked him from his 
thoughts. The thrush dived suddenly 
down and landed in front of one of the 
slabs. It began rummaging in the grass 
with its beak. Hope sparked beneath 
Tigerheart’s pelt. Slowly, he drew 
himself to his paws and began to creep 
toward it. The stone slabs hid his 
approach. He quickened his pace. He 
had to reach the thrush before it fluttered 
away again. Slow down, he told himself. 
He couldn’t let desperation make him 


mess this up. 

Stopping behind the slab where the 
thrush was digging for worms, 
Tigerheart steadied his breath. He 
peered around the edge. The thrush 
hadn’t noticed him. As he eased into the 
open, Tigerheart’s belly fluttered with 
excitement. Whiskers twitching, he 
pounced and slapped his paws onto the 
thrush a moment before it could flap 
away in panic. Pinning it to the earth, he 
grabbed its neck between his jaws and 
killed it fast. Thank you, StarClan. 
Happiness surged through him at the 
taste of blood. He picked it up in his 
teeth, relishing its warm prey-scent as he 
hurried back to the den. 


“Wake up!” He dropped his catch at 
the side of Dovewing’s nest. 

Dovewing lifted her head, her nose 
twitching. “Thrush!” Pleasure sparked in 
her green gaze as she sat up and looked 
from Tigerheart to the limp bird. She 
prodded the kits, still snuggling against 
her belly. “Wake up, Pouncekit! Lightkit, 
wake up.” She lapped Shadowkit 
between the ears. “Tigerheart’s brought 
food.” 

Blinking in the sunshine, which 
flooded the den, Pouncekit peered over 
the side of the nest. Her shoulders 
drooped as she saw the thrush. “That’s 
not food,” she mewed sadly. “It’s just a 
bird.” 


“It’s prey!” Tigerheart bristled 
angrily. “And you’re going to eat it.” 

Lightkit scrambled out of the den, her 
brown tabby kit fluff ruffled by sleep. 
She sniffed at the thrush. “It smells 
sweet.” 

Shadowkit balanced on the edge of 
the nest, his nose twitching suspiciously. 
“Weren’t there any scraps?” He looked 
across the den to where the guardian cats 
were lounging, the scraps they'd 
gathered gone. 

Pouncekit followed his gaze, 
sniffing. “I can smell meat.” She scanned 
the den. 

“This is meat.” Tigerheart poked the 
thrush. 


“Its all feathers.” Pouncekit 
dismissed it with a flick of her muzzle. 

Tigerheart’s belly tightened. Why 
wasn’t the scent of fresh-kill making 
them hungry? 

Dovewing climbed out of the nest 
and began to tear the thrush into strips as 
the kits watched with a look of horrified 
fascination. Putting the feathery parts 
aside, she laid a small, meaty strip in 
front of each of them. 

Irritation clawed Tigerheart’s belly. 
“Tawnypelt never had to tear my food up 
when I was a kit.” 

Dovewing shot him a look. “Of 
course she did. They’re only two moons 
old. You can’t expect them to rip up their 


own prey.” 

Tigerheart sat back on his haunches. 
Perhaps she was right. He must be 
patient. 

“Try it,’ Dovewing encouraged the 
kits gently. 

Pouncekit sniffed uneasily at the 
strip of red meat before dabbing it with 
her tongue. She frowned and dabbed it 
again. Shadowkit touched his piece with 
his paw before sinking his teeth in. 
Lightkit grabbed one end of hers in her 
mouth and, hooking the strip with her 
claw, began tugging it with her teeth. 

Dovewing blinked affectionately at 
Tigerheart. “It was good of you to catch 
fresh prey for us.” 


Tigerheart didn’t answer. He was 
still staring anxiously at the kits. What if 
they never learned to love fresh-kill? 
What if he took them back to 
ShadowClan and they refused to eat? 

“All kits are fussy about food at 
first,’ Dovewing murmured. “Ivypool 
refused to eat rabbit until she was four 
moons old. And I hated shrews.” 

“Really?” Tigerheart looked 
hopefully at her. 

She held his gaze for a moment, then 
nodded at the kits. All three were busy 
chewing on their strips of thrush. 
Shadowkit looked thoughtful. Pouncekit 
was still frowning. Lightkit’s cheeks 
bulged with food where she’d bitten off 


too much. 

“Chew it properly before you 
swallow,” Dovewing warned. “Or 
you'll get a bellyache.” 

Tigerheart watched them eat, pride 
swelling in his chest. Even if they didn’t 
like the thrush, they were trying to eat it. 
Your kits will be warriors. Spire’s 
words rang in his mind. Of course they 
would be. Especially if he took them 
home soon. 





CHAPTER 20 
Cog 


Tigerheart fluffed his fur against the 
cold. Outside the gathering place, wind 
whipped rain against the stone slabs. 
Fierce, Spire, and Ant were already 
heading across the grass. Beside him, 
Dovewing shivered. 

“Are you sure you want to come?” 
Tigerheart glanced at her. It would be the 
first time she’d left the den since kitting. 

“I need fresh air.” She lifted her face 
into the breeze, half closing her eyes 
against the rain; then she stiffened and 
looked anxiously at Tigerheart. “Blaze 
and Peanut will take good care of the 


kits, won’t they?” 

“Of course,” he reassured her. 
“Blaze will keep them busy, and Peanut 
will make sure they stay out of troub—” 
He paused as a familiar scent touched 
his nose. 

He’d learned by now to untangle 
jumbled city scents and pick out prey, 
cat, fox, and food smells from the acrid 
stench of monsters. He could smell the 
gray she-cat they’d met the day before. 
His ears twitched uneasily. Ant, Fierce, 
and Spire had reached the Thunderpath 
and were waiting for a gap to cross. 
“Come back!” 

Fierce looked back questioningly 
and turned back as Tigerheart beckoned 


her with a flick of his tail. Ant and Spire 
followed. “What is it?” 

Tigerheart sniffed the air again, 
smelling the she-cat once more. Other 
cat scents mingled with it. “The strays 
have been here.” The smell strengthened 
with the wind. “They’re still around.” 
Tigerheart jerked his nose toward an 
unkempt patch of trees and bushes at the 
far end of the gathering place. Was that 
movement in the long grass beside it? 
His pelt prickled. “They’ve invaded our 
land!” Without waiting, he raced toward 
the cat scents. He stopped as he reached 
the trees and stared into the bushes 
crowding their trunks. “Come out!” he 
demanded. 


The branches rustled, and the gray 
she-cat slid out and gazed at him 
impassively. “Hi again.” 

“What are you doing here?” 
Tigerheart demanded as Dovewing 
caught up to him. She was panting a 
little. It had clearly been a while since 
she’d run. Fierce, Ant, and Spire 
followed slowly. 

The gray she-cat stared at Tigerheart, 
looking puzzled. 

He glanced at the guardian cats. 
They didn’t look concerned. “She’s on 
our land!” he growled. 

“This isn’t our land.” Fierce flicked 
her tail as she reached him. 

Tigerheart could hardly believe his 


ears. “It’s where you live and hunt.” 

Ant frowned. “We sleep in the 
gathering place and scavenge all over 
the city.” He clearly didn’t understand. 

“But this is your home.” Tigerheart 
glanced around the stretch of grass 
surrounding the thorn den. 

A tom emerged from the bushes, 
followed by three other strays. They 
lined up beside the gray she-cat, blinking 
at him curiously. 

“What’s the fuss about, Fog?” A 
brown tom looked at the gray she-cat. 

“Pm not sure, Tuna.” Fog stared at 
Tigerheart. “This cat’s complaining 
again.” 

Tigerheart struggled to understand 


their indifference. Even Dovewing 
looked unconcerned. If this were the 
forest, pelts would be bristling and teeth 
bared by now. He blinked at Dovewing. 
“I know this is the city, but all cats have 
territory, right? Don’t they want to 
defend it?” 

She looked at him. “They obviously 
don’t mind sharing.” She looked at 
Fierce inquiringly. 

Fierce shrugged. “What’s the point 
of arguing over land?” 

Tigerheart stared at her. “Don’t you 
have borders?” 

“No.” 

“Well, you should.” He looked 
pointedly at Fog. “Then other cats would 


know not to trespass.” 

Rain dripped from Fierce’s whiskers 
as she glanced past Fog. “Have you built 
dens here?” 

“Not dens,” Fog answered. “Just a 
few nests. Foxes invaded our old home. 
We needed a new place to sleep.” 

Tigerheart pricked his ears. “So 
you're planning to make a new home 
here?” 

Fog shrugged. “Why not? We won’t 
bother you.” 

Tigerheart narrowed his eyes 
accusingly. “What about yesterday?” he 
challenged. “You tried to steal our 
food.” 

Tuna shifted his paws. “We were just 


scavenging, like you.” 

Tigerheart growled. “In the future, 
don’t scavenge where we scavenge.” 

Fog stared back innocently. “We’re 
still getting used to this part of the city. 
We didn’t know you owned the 
scrapcans here.” Her pelt ruffled into 
spikes as rain soaked her fur. 

“Go easy on them.” Fierce swished 
her tail at Tigerheart. “They’ve had fox 
trouble. We know what that’s like.” 

Tigerheart didn’t care. He was 
wondering how many more cats were 
hiding in the bushes. “Are you going to 
let them stay on your land?” 

“I told you,” Fierce meowed. “This 
isn’t our land. We don’t own land.” 


“How do you know where you can 
hunt?” Tigerheart couldn’t understand 
how they could live in such a 
disorganized way. “You have sick cats to 
feed,” he reminded her. “And kits. You 
need to know you have territory that can 
support them even in the coldest 
weather. You—” 

Fog interrupted him. “What’s the 
weather got to do with it? Do you think 
Twolegs stop leaving trash because it 
gets cold? Ice-chill is the best weather 
for scavenging. Food rots slower.” 

“Come on.” Fierce began to head 
away. “This argument is pointless. These 
cats aren’t harming anyone.” 

Ant and Spire followed her 


wordlessly. Tigerheart exchanged looks 
with Dovewing. Foreboding hollowed 
his belly. Hadn’t Rowanstar let rogues 
live beside ShadowClan land because 
he thought they wouldn’t do any harm? 

Fog shook rain from her fur and 
headed back into the dripping bushes. 
Her companions followed. 

Alone with Dovewing, Tigerheart’s 
pelt prickled along his spine. “I can see 
trouble coming.” 

“I know it’s different from how 
Clans live, but the cats here seem happy 
with it.” Dovewing began to head after 
Fierce, Spire, and Ant. 

Tigerheart wondered why Dovewing 
didn’t see the danger in living so 


chaotically. “They may be happy now, 
but what if Fog and her friends decide 
they want a warmer den and invade the 
gathering place? There are sick cats 
there who can’t defend themselves! Just 
because the guardian cats chased off a 
couple of foxes, it doesn’t mean they’re 
ready for a full battle over territory.” He 
paused, his heart quickening. “They 
don’t even understand what territory is!” 

Fierce, Ant, and Spire were already 
crossing the puddled Thunderpath. 
Dovewing stopped at the edge and 
blinked at Tigerheart. “We can’t tell 
them to change the way they live,” she 
argued. ““We’re just visitors here.” 

“But don’t you want to help them?” 


He trotted after her. 

“Not if they don’t want to be 
helped.” 

“But it’s so obvious.” As he reached 
her, Tigerheart felt exasperated. “All 
they need to do is mark some boundaries 
and organize some patrols, and everyone 
will sleep a lot safer in their nests.” 

Monsters sent up spray as they 
passed. Crouching against it, Dovewing 
waited for a gap and then splashed 
across the Thunderpath. Tigerheart 
followed. “This isn’t a Clan, Tigerheart. 
These cats don’t even have a leader. 
They’re just a bunch of healers and 
scavengers who have been kind to us. 
Don’t start bossing them around.” 


“I wasn’t bossing.” Tigerheart’s 
paws pricked indignantly. 

Dovewing went on. “I know you’re 
used to being Clan deputy and believing 
that one day you'll be leader. But you’re 
not in the forest now, and you won’t be 
for a while. So you might as well get 
used to living like a city cat.” 

Ahead, Ant, Spire, and Fierce turned 
a corner. Dovewing quickened her pace. 
Tigerheart hurried beside her, his 
thoughts churning. And you won t be for 
a while. He glanced at Dovewing, trying 
to read her gaze. The kits would be 
ready to travel soon, surely? They were 
weaned now and growing stronger each 
day. “How long are you planning to stay 


here?” 

“Are you in a rush to get back to the 
lake?” She kept her gaze ahead, scanning 
the bustling Twolegs as they turned the 
corner. 

“I want our kits to grow up in 
ShadowClan,” Tigerheart told her. 

“Why not ThunderClan?” Dovewing 
dodged between a Twoleg’s paws. The 
guardian cats were waiting at the mouth 
of an alley. 

Tigerheart stared at Dovewing. Was 
she planning to take their kits to 
ThunderClan? His belly tightened. “I’m 
ShadowClan’s deputy. I can’t just join 
another Clan.” 

“But J can?” Dovewing shot him a 


look. “Besides, are you sure there’s a 
ShadowClan to go back to? Didn’t you 
say it might disappear? Who knows what 
might have happened while we’ve been 
away?” 

How could she say that so casually? 
Had Dovewing stopped caring about the 
Clans? Had she forgotten how much 
she’d loved her life before she came to 
the city? Didn’t she remember what it 
was like to be a warrior? His pelt 
prickled uneasily. She had never 
complained about feeding scraps to the 
kits. And she didn’t seem to worry about 
territory anymore. Was she enjoying this 
life? The thought struck him like a blow. 
He steered her to the side of the path, out 


of the way of Twolegs. “Don’t you want 
to go back?” 

“Of course I want to go back.” 
Dovewing blinked at him, her green eyes 
sparking as the rain pattered around 
them. “But I want our kits to be safe. It’s 
a long journey, and it might be 
dangerous.” 

“But they need to grow up in a Clan, 
among Clan cats, with the warrior code, 
or they may never truly understand what 
it is to be a warrior. We need to get them 
home as soon as possible.” 

“Even if that means endangering 
their lives?” Dovewing’s hackles lifted. 

“Of course not.” Tigerheart’s fur 
prickled uncomfortably. “Pd never let 


harm come to our kits.” 

“Then why are you in such a rush to 
leave? They’re only two moons old.” 
Dovewing didn’t wait for an answer. 
She turned away and hurried toward the 
guardian cats. 

Heart pounding with anxiety, 
Tigerheart followed her. 

He didn’t speak as Fierce led them 
on a tour of her favorite scrapcans. He 
waited while the others rummaged 
through the trash, and he gathered up the 
scraps they tossed down and hid them. 
As they headed down another wet alley, 
he glimpsed movement at the end. 
Something small was scuttling there. He 
opened his mouth, letting damp air bathe 


his tongue. Prey. Narrowing his eyes, he 
made out the slick pelts of several black 
rats. They were swarming at the end of 
the alley where a tall mesh fence 
blocked the end. 

“Look!” Tigerheart nudged 
Dovewing and jerked his muzzle toward 
the rats. 

Fierce, in a scrapcan above them, 
stopped delving. Ant and Spire paused. 
They followed Tigerheart’s gaze. 

“Let’s catch them,” Tigerheart flexed 
his claws eagerly. 

“But this can is full.” Fierce dropped 
a soggy scrap onto the ground. 

“Fresh prey will be better for the 
sick cats,” Tigerheart pointed out. 


“Littlecloud used to say that warm fresh- 
kill was the best medicine.” 

Spire nodded. “That scrawny tom 
we took in last quarter moon could do 
with some fresh meat.” 

Dovewing shifted her paws. “I guess 
the kits have to get used to fresh-kill 
eventually.” 

You guess?  ‘Tigerheart’s belly 
tightened. “Come on.” Without waiting, 
he hurried along the alley. 

Dovewing and the guardian cats 
followed. 

The rats were bunched against the 
mesh at the end. This would be an easy 
kill. Tigerheart swiped his tongue 
around his lips and dropped into a 


stalking crouch as he neared them. The 
others fanned out beside him. 

The rats saw them. Fear sparked in 
their small, black eyes. They scrabbled 
against the fence, squabbling as they 
fought to escape. One squeezed through a 
gap where the mesh was torn. It escaped 
into the alley beyond. A moment later, 
the other rats broke through and 
streamed after it. 

“Quick!” Tigerheart leaped to the 
fence and, seeing where the mesh was 
torn, tugged a curled edge with his paws. 
Triumph sparked in his chest as it gave 
easily and opened into a gap big enough 
to push through. The swarm of rats was 
already at the end of the alley. They 


disappeared around the corner as he 
scraped through the gap and raced after 
them. 

He heard the guardian cats splashing 
through the puddles behind him as he 
rounded the corner and spotted the rats 
fleeing downhill. They were following 
the edge of a Thunderpath as it 
disappeared into a tunnel. 

Dovewing caught up to him. “Where 
are they?” 

“In there.” He nodded toward the 
tunnel and ran harder. Dovewing was at 
his tail as darkness swallowed him. 
Monsters roared through the tunnel, their 
blazing eyes illuminating the stone 
walls. Tigerheart glimpsed the rats in 


their eye beams. They were running for 
the light at the far end. 

Tigerheart glanced over his shoulder. 
Fierce, Spire, and Ant were catching up, 
and as he neared the end, they spread out 
beside him. He charged out into the rain 
with them at his side. “There they go!” 

The rats were streaming away from 
the Thunderpath, toward a vast field of 
trash piled high beside water. “We have 
to catch them before they reach the 
trash.” There was no way they’d be able 
to follow them into the chaotic mess of 
discarded Twoleg litter. He pushed 
harder, leading the patrol close to the 
trash. If they could steer the rats away 
from it, they could catch them. He was 


close now, herding the rats toward a 
muddy ditch at the bottom of a slope. 
The ditch would crowd them together 
and slow their flight. Stragglers would 
fall behind, and it would be easy to pick 
them off. 

Suddenly the rats veered sideways. 
Tigerheart blinked in surprise as the 
terrified prey cut across his path. He 
lunged for them, but he’d been caught off 
guard. They streamed around him, 
slipping around his paws. He stretched 
his claws, trying to get a grip on the wet 
stone as the rats fled out of reach. What 
had made them change course? He 
glanced up the slope. Fog and Tuna were 
pounding toward him, a white tom at 


their heels. Their eyes were fixed on the 
rats, which swarmed into the trash field, 
where they scattered. Fog, Tuna, and the 
white tom pulled up as the rats 
disappeared among the heaps of stinking 
litter. 

“You scared them away!” Tigerheart 
faced the strays angrily. 

“Why didn’t you stop them?” Fog 
blinked at him. “They were right under 
your paws.” 

“Have you ever tried catching rats 
before? They're fast and they’re 
slippery.” Tigerheart jerked his nose 
toward the ditch. “Z had a plan and you 
ruined it! You drove them straight into 
the trash field.” These cats hunted like 


mouse-brains. As Fierce slewed to a 
halt beside him, Tigerheart glared at her. 
“This is why you need borders!” he 
snapped. “If you knew where your land 
was, you could hunt there without other 
cats interfering with your catch.” 

Ant, Spire, and Dovewing reached 
them and stared at the strays. 

Tuna stared back. He nodded to the 
white tom. “These are the cats we 
mentioned, Streak.” 

Streak looked at them through 
narrowed eyes. “Are they the ones who 
live inside that big, warm, dry den?” 

Tigerheart glared at Fog. “You 
promised to keep out of our way.” 

She flicked her tail. “You told us not 


to scavenge. We’re not scavenging; 
we’re hunting.” 

Fierce shook rain from her pelt. 
“Let’s go back to the scrapcans. The rats 
are gone, and there’s more shelter in the 
alleys.” 

“Don’t you care that they frightened 
our prey away?” Tigerheart didn’t wait 
for an answer. “We must establish 
borders now. We need to know which 
land belongs to us and which belongs to 
them.” 

Fog looked toward the trash heaped 
over the field. “You can have this land,” 
she offered. 

Fierce wrinkled her nose. “The 
scraps here are rotten.” 


“But there are plenty of rats for you 
to hunt.” Fog caught Tigerheart’s eye 
scornfully. “Go ahead.” 

The stench wafting from the trash 
made Tigerheart feel sick. “No, thanks.” 
If he’d known this was where the rats 
scavenged, he’d never have chased 
them. 

Spire shivered. “I’m getting cold. 
Let’s go back to the scrapcans. It 
smelled like there were bones in them.” 

Streak’s eyes lit up. “Which cans?” 

Tuna licked his lips. “We could help 
you look.” 

“I told you not to scavenge where we 
scavenge.” Tigerheart unsheathed his 
claws. 


“And I told you, this is the city. We 
can scavenge where we like.” Fog’s 
eyes suddenly darkened. 

Tigerheart glimpsed menace there. 
These cats meant trouble. “We need 
borders,” he growled. 

“Borders need patrolling. It sounds 
like a lot of effort.” Fierce flicked 
raindrops from her ears. 

“She’s right,” Fog sniffed. “It would 
be better to spend the time scavenging.” 

Tuna whisked his tail nonchalantly. 
“The city is full of cats. It’s pointless 
making boundaries.” 

Spire agreed. “We’d just have more 
to fight over. I don’t want to waste herbs 
treating battle wounds.” 


“Live and let live.” Fierce headed 
toward the tunnel. 

“Life’s too short to bother with 
grudges.” Fog headed up the slope, Tuna 
and Streak at her tail. Spire and Ant 
padded after Fierce. 

Tigerheart watched them go. “I don’t 
trust her,” he told Dovewing. 

“Who? Fog?” Dovewing blinked at 
him. “She’s just another stray. You know 
what city cats are like. They like an easy 
life.” 

“An easy life.” Tigerheart snorted. 
“There’s no such thing.” 

“The guardian cats seem to have a 
pretty easy time.” 

“They need to learn to defend 


themselves.” 

“Why fight if you don’t have to?” 
Dovewing touched her nose to 
Tigerheart’s cheek. “I know you miss 
your Clan. But we’re not going to change 
these cats. Why bother trying?” 

She turned and followed Fierce, Ant, 
and Spire. 

Why fight if you dont have to? 
Tigerheart stared after her. Of course 
they’d have to, one day. The city was 
crowded. There was little space to roam 
or scavenge undisturbed. Sooner or 
later, they’d find themselves competing 
for the same scrapcans. With so many 
cats and no borders, eventually their 
lives would descend into an endless 


running battle. 

Icy rain soaked deeper into his fur. 
Why did city cats have so little honor? 
They were hardly better than foxes. And 
Dovewing was starting to agree with 
them. His heart ached. He missed the 
warrior code. He missed feeling proud 
at the end of a hard day’s patrolling. Was 
he the only cat here who saw himself as 
more than a scavenger? 





CHAPTER 21 
Cog 


“Why are there more nests now?” 
Lightkit looked out from beneath the 
ledge that sheltered their nest, while 
behind her, Shadowkit chased Pouncekit 
around its wooden legs. 

Tigerheart followed the kit’s gaze to 
the two new heaps of furless pelts, 
which Bracken, Boots, and Spire had 
assembled. “Mittens and Rascal found 
two sick cats while they were out 
scavenging yesterday. They brought them 
back so the medicine cats can look after 
them.” 

Lightkit blinked at him. “How come 


you call them medicine cats when 
everyone else calls them healers?” 

“Because that’s what we call healers 
back home,” Tigerheart explained. 

Pouncekit skidded to a halt beside 
them. Shadowkit bundled after her, his 
tiny paws slipping on the shiny floor. 

“Dovewing says that home is such a 
long way away it would take days and 
days to walk there,” Pouncekit mewed. 

“Will we ever go there?” Lightkit 
asked eagerly. 

Shadowkit shifted his paws. “It’s 
dark in the forest.” 

Tigerheart glanced at him sharply. 
How did he know what the forest was 
like? Tigerheart had talked of trees and 


prey, but not of light and shadow. And 
the kit had spoken solemnly, as though 
his words carried hidden meaning. This 
one will see into the shadows. Spire’s 
words rang in his mind. Did Shadowkit 
know something? Had shadows 
swallowed his Clan? Tigerheart 
swallowed back fear. Don’t be dumb! 
How could a kit know what was 
happening in ShadowClan? He’d never 
even been there. Dovewing had 
probably told the kits how dark the pine 
forest could be. It probably did seem 
dark to her. She was ThunderClan after 
all. “The woods are shadowy,” he 
conceded. “But when you train to be 
warriors, you'll find the shadows are 


your friend. You can hide in shadows, or 
keep cool in them, or shelter there from 
bad weather.” 

“I don’t want to hide in shadows.” 
Lightkit gazed up at the clear stretches of 
wall. Blue sky showed beyond. “I like 
sunshine.” 

Pouncekit padded toward the middle 
of the den. “Can we go and look at the 
new cats?” 

“No,” Tigerheart told him. “They’re 
sick. Leave them in peace.” 

“But Spire gets to look at them,” 
Pouncekit argued. The healer was 
leaning over one of the new nests, where 
a black-and-white tom was wheezing. 

“He’s taking care of them,” 


Tigerheart explained. His gaze drifted 
longingly toward Fierce. The 
tortoiseshell was padding between 
Cobweb, Ant, Rascal, Mittens, and 
Dotty. They were going on a special 
patrol. 

Fierce and the other guardian cats 
had been talking excitedly about it for 
days. “We call it the outdoor gathering,” 
Fierce had told him. “Every moon, 
Twolegs set up ledges in the biggest 
stone clearing in the city and pile food 
on them, right out in the open, even when 
it’s raining or snowing. There’s smoke 
and some fire. The smells are delicious. 
It’s easy to scavenge. There are Twolegs 
everywhere, but no one looks at what 


happens under the ledges. Sometimes 
they drop food. Sometimes we can reach 
up and take it. Some of the ledges are 
covered with meat.” Fierce had paused 
to lick her lips hungrily. “Meat like 
you've probably never seen or smelled 
before. We always feast well after the 
outdoor gathering.” 

Tigerheart wanted to join the patrol. 
Hurry up, Dovewing! He glanced at the 
den entrance. She’d gone out to make 
dirt. He couldn’t leave the kits. Perhaps 
Blaze and Peanut would watch them 
again. His heart leaped as he saw a gray 
pelt beyond the clear stretch of glass 
beside the entrance. Dovewing slid 
through. 


Tigerheart blinked at the kits. 
“Dovewing’s back. Be good for her. I’m 
going out with Fierce.” 

“When can we go outside?” 
Pouncekit’s mew echoed after him as he 
hurried across the floor. He passed 
Dovewing and paused, his head 
drooping. “I wish I could bring home 
real prey,” he told her. 

She nosed him playfully. “I don’t 
care what you bring home, so long as it 
fills the kits’ bellies.” She hurried 
quickly away as Pouncekit, Lightkit, and 
Shadowkit raced to meet her. 

Blaze charged from between the 
nests where Spire was tending to the 
sick cats. “Can I come?” he asked. 


“There will be a lot of Twolegs 
there,” Tigerheart warned. The young 
tom had grown in the past two moons, 
but he was still a kit. Tigerheart didn’t 
want to lose him in the crowd. 

“Please?” Blaze trotted beside 
Tigerheart. “Spire’s busy with the new 
cats. It’s boring here. I want to see the 
outdoor gathering.” 

Fierce looked up as they reached 
her. “Are you coming?” she asked 
Tigerheart. 

“Yes, please.” 

“T want to come too,” Blaze mewed. 

Fierce glanced at the young tom. She 
narrowed her eyes thoughtfully. “Yow d 
make a good lookout,” she meowed. 


“You could help Dotty guard the stash.” 
She glanced at the pale white-and-ginger 
she-cat. 

Dotty nodded. “Don’t wander off,” 
she warned Blaze. “It gets crowded. You 
have to stay near me, okay?” 

“Okay.” Blaze nodded eagerly. 

Fierce headed for the den entrance 
and leaped onto the wooden ledge. 
Tigerheart waited for the rest of the 
patrol to follow and fell in at the rear. 
He jumped up onto the ledge and 
squeezed out of the entrance after Rascal 
and Mittens. 

Fierce followed a new route away 
from the gathering place. Tigerheart had 
never been this way before. It led 


through quieter streets, where few 
monsters and even fewer Twolegs 
patrolled outdoors. Then she cut through 
a narrow alley, which opened onto a 
wide, open stretch of stone. The clearing 
was lined with ledges, just as Fierce had 
promised. The Twolegs had decorated 
them in bright colors; some had roofs. 
Tigerheart could see food piled high 
wherever he looked. The smell of smoke 
tinged the air. Fire? He scanned the 
clearing warily and saw plumes rising 
here and there among the ledges. But 
there was no sign of fire raging out of 
control. And the smoke carried 
mouthwatering scents. Countless 
Twolegs filed slowly between the 


ledges, picking at the food, lifting it to 
smell it, passing it to other Twolegs to 
wrap. Delicious scents filled 
Tigerheart’s nose. His belly growled 
with longing. He hadn’t smelled such 
tempting prey since he’d left the forest. 
No wonder the guardian cats came every 
moon and were willing to brave the 
crowds of Twolegs to scavenge here. 

Fierce led the patrol quickly beneath 
a line of ledges. Twoleg paws padded 
around the edges, but in the shadows 
beneath, Tigerheart felt safe. A Twoleg 
would have to crawl on all fours to see 
them. 

“We could keep the stash here.” 
Dotty stopped beside two low stones 


jutting up from the ground. Dotty reached 
into the gap between. “This will be easy 
to guard.” 

“From what?” Tigerheart wondered 
out loud. 

Rascal glanced around. “Some of the 
Twolegs bring dogs. They keep them tied 
to vines. But the dogs can still reach 
under the ledges.” 

“Don’t worry.” Dotty unsheathed her 
claws. “A few quick swipes will scare 
then away.” 

“Not too vicious, though,” Fierce 
warned. “Remember. We mustn’t attract 
the Twolegs’ attention.” 

Mittens lifted his nose, his eyes 
sparkling. “I’m heading for the ledge 


where they pile the fish.” 

Cobweb purred. “Pll come with 
you.” 

Tigerheart blinked at the two cats. 
“You like fish?” 

“All cats like fish,” Ant meowed. 

Tigerheart wrinkled his nose. 
“Where I come from, we only eat prey 
with legs. Except RiverClan.” 

The other cats stared at him as 
though he were crazy. His pelt prickled 
self-consciously. 

Fierce whisked her tail. “Pll take 
Tigerheart and Cobweb to see what food 
the Twolegs have brought this moon.” 
She nodded at Mittens, Rascal, and Ant. 
“You hunt for fish while Blaze and Dotty 


wait here.” 

The patrol split, and Tigerheart 
followed Fierce and Cobweb as they 
slid from the ledges and dodged between 
the Twolegs streaming past. With relief, 
Tigerheart saw another row of ledges 
and ducked under it with the others. 

Fierce tasted the air. “This way.” 
The ledges formed a tunnel, edged with 
Twoleg paws, and she led the way along 
it before dashing across another stream 
of Twolegs, and then another, until they 
reached a ledge where the scent of food 
was so strong, Tigerheart’s mouth began 
to water. Fierce stopped beneath it and 
glanced up at a narrow gap. A grouse’s 
head hung over the edge. Fierce lifted 


her forepaws off the ground and peered 
through the slit. “No one’s watching,” 
she whispered. Reaching up a paw, she 
tugged at the grouse’s head. It shifted a 
little, then tumbled through the gap. 

Tigerheart stared down at the fat 
piece of prey. He couldn’t believe his 
eyes. A grouse in the middle of the city. 
Delight surged beneath his pelt. The kits 
were going to taste real prey today. 

“Take it to Dotty, then come back 
here,” Fierce told him. 

Eagerly, Tigerheart lifted the grouse 
between his jaws. The weight of it 
reminded him of hunting trips with 
ShadowClan. None of the scraps they 
scavenged from scrapcans weighed so 


much or smelled so good. Musky prey- 
scent filled his nose as he carried the 
grouse along the ledge tunnel. Peering 
between the brightly pelted paws of the 
Twolegs, he scanned the far ledges, 
looking for Dotty. He spotted her, 
crouching with Blaze beside the jutting 
stones. Looking both ways, he waited 
patiently for a gap in the stream of 
Twolegs that filled the space between 
the ledges. As the crowd eased, he 
darted from one row to another until he 
reached the stash place. 

“Wow.” Blaze stared wide-eyed at 
the grouse as he dropped it between the 
stones. “I’ve never seen fresh-kill that 
big.” 


“Fierce and Cobweb are collecting 
more.” As Tigerheart spoke, Rascal and 
Mittens dashed toward him, Ant on their 
tail. Each cat held a glittering fish 
between his jaws. 

They dropped the fish between the 
Stones. 

“They re here,” Rascal huffed. 

“Who?” Alarm sparked in 
Tigerheart’s chest. 

“Fog and her gang,” Ant told him. 
“They’re scavenging.” 

Tigerheart peered through the maze 
of ledges, his fur spiking as he spotted 
Tuna slinking through the shadows on the 
far side of the clearing. Fog was with 
him, and an orange she-cat. Fog stopped 


and signaled to another group of cats 
nearby with a flick of her tail. How 
many cats did Fog have following her? 
Unease rippled beneath Tigerheart’s 
pelt. 

Dotty followed his gaze, her fur 
pricking nervously. “There’s enough 
food here for everyone to share, isn’t 
there?” She sounded uncertain. 

“Tf Fog wants to share it,” Tigerheart 
meowed darkly. He didn’t trust the 
smoky she-cat. She’d chased away the 
guardian cats’ rats. What if she wasn’t 
simply a mouse-brained hunter? What if 
she’d been trying to wreck the guardian 
cats’ hunt? Perhaps depriving her rivals 
of prey was more important than hunting. 


Perhaps she was just here to cause 
trouble, like Darktail. He nodded to Ant, 
Rascal, and Mittens. “Keep collecting 
prey. Pll warn Fierce.” 

He headed back toward the meat 
ledge where he’d left Cobweb and 
Fierce. They greeted him, eyes shining. 
Fresh-kill was piled at their paws. 
“We’ll have to make several trips back 
to the gathering place with a haul as big 
as this,” Fierce meowed happily. 

“Lets get this back to Dotty 
quickly.” Tigerheart nodded anxiously at 
the prey. 

Fierce narrowed her eyes. “Is 
something wrong?” 

“Fog and her gang are here.” 


Fierce shrugged. “I guess they’re 
looking for food. It’s not a problem. 
They need to eat just like we do.” 

Tigerheart gazed at her. She’d 
clearly never had to deal with cats like 
Darktail. “Not all cats want to share.” 

“What do you mean?” Cobweb 
glanced around nervously. 

“When Fog chased those rats into the 
trash field, did it look like she wanted to 
catch them?” Tigerheart stared at Fierce. 

Fierce looked puzzled. 

“Was she chasing them, or was she 
just trying to scatter them so we couldn’t 
catch them?” Tigerheart pressed. 

Fierce frowned. “You think she 
wants to stop us scavenging. Why?” 


“Pm not sure,” Tigerheart admitted. 
“But she’s camped outside your den, and 
we seem to trip over her wherever we 
go. I think she might be trying to take 
over your territory.” 

Fierce looked unconvinced. “But we 
don’t have territory.” 

“So you keep saying.” Exasperation 
tightened Tigerheart’s belly. “But you 
have places where you live and places 
where you scavenge. Imagine if you 
couldn’t live beneath the gathering place 
anymore. Imagine if you had to fight 
every time you wanted to rummage 
through your favorite scrapcans.” He 
remembered the rot pile cats. They'd 
stopped Dash’s scavenging. City cats 


weren’t as easygoing as they liked to 
make out. “Imagine Fog sleeping in your 
nest.” 

“She couldn’t!” Fierce looked 
alarmed for the first time. 

“Why not?” Tigerheart pressed. “She 
has more cats with her every time we 
see her. Her gang is getting bigger, and 
she has no sick cats to care for, or kits. If 
she decides to drive you out of your 
home, she could probably do it.” 

As he spoke, he saw alarm flash in 
Cobweb’s eyes. He followed the gray 
tom’s gaze and saw Fog, Tuna, and a 
stout black-and-white tom padding 
toward them. “Take this catch to Dotty,” 
Tigerheart ordered. “Ill speak to Fog.” 


Fierce and Cobweb snatched up 
what they could, leaving a rabbit beside 
Tigerheart as they hurried away. 

Tigerheart turned to face Fog. 

The gray she-cat padded toward him, 
her eyes glittering with satisfaction. 
“T’ve never seen this place before.” She 
stopped in front of him and looked down 
at the rabbit. “Perhaps it’s a good thing 
those foxes drove us out of our home. 
The scraps here are much better than 
anything we used to scavenge.” She 
glanced at the black-and-white tom. “I 
bet you’re glad you joined our little 
community, Growler.” 

The tom purred and reached a paw 
toward the rabbit. 


Tigerheart slapped it away, keeping 
his claws sheathed. He wasn’t going to 
fight unless he had to. “I thought you 
didn’t want to invade our territory.” 

“I thought you didn’t have any 
territory,” Fog countered. 

“Maybe the guardian cats don’t, but I 
do.” Tigerheart curled his lip. 

Fog looked at Tuna and then 
Growler. “And you’re going to defend it 
single-pawed?” 

“I'm going to stop you stealing my 
catch.” Tigerheart dragged the rabbit 
closer. 

“I told you.” Fog’s eyes shimmered 
with menace. “In the city, it’s every cat 
for herself.” She darted forward and 


hooked the rabbit away. 

Anger scorched through Tigerheart’s 
fur. With a hiss, he swiped his claws 
across her cheek. Paws slammed into his 
flank as the black-and-white tom flew at 
him. Tigerheart fell onto his side. 
Kicking out his hind legs, he knocked 
Tuna away before he could join the fight. 
Then he rolled nimbly back onto his 
paws and reared. Growler glared at him, 
hissing. Fog lunged, her claws stretched 
as she raked his muzzle. Tigerheart 
ducked his head and rammed it into her 
belly. He lifted her off her paws and 
tossed her to one side, then spun and 
faced the black-and-white tom. Thrusting 
his muzzle forward, he snapped at 


Growler’s leg. He sank his teeth in hard, 
tasting blood and feeling bone. The tom 
screeched and pulled away. Claws 
pierced Tigerheart’s tail. He spun and 
saw Tuna clinging on. With a snarl he 
aimed a flurry of swipes at Tuna’s 
muzzle. Yowling, Tuna ducked away. 
Gray fur flashed at the side of 
Tigerheart’s vision. He turned in time to 
see Fog attacking once more. He reared 
to meet her as she dived at him, and he 
wrapped his forelegs around her. 
Knocking her off her paws, he rolled her 
onto her back and began churning her 
belly with his hind claws. She 
screeched, struggling in his grasp. 
Clinging on, Tigerheart rolled from 


under the ledge. Alarm shrilled beneath 
his pelt as he knocked against a pair of 
Twoleg paws. The Twoleg screeched. 
Around him, the clearing exploded 
into chaos as Twolegs yelped and 
howled and waved their front paws. 
They crowded around him and glared, 
their white, sunken eyes stretched in 
surprise. Tigerheart let go of Fog and 
ran. Dodging between shrieking 
Twolegs, he hared along the small alley 
between ledges before ducking into 
shadow. He glimpsed Dotty ahead. 
Fierce and Cobweb were with her. 
Blaze stared at him with wide eyes. Ant, 
Mittens, and Rascal streaked toward 
them, fish between their jaws. “Grab 


m? 


what you can and get out of here 
Tigerheart yowled. They snatched prey 
in their teeth and headed for the alley. 
Tigerheart grabbed the grouse as he 
passed the jutting stones and followed 
them. 

Twoleg shrieks followed Tigerheart 
and the others as they skimmed the stone, 
veered away from the stone clearing, 
and ducked into the alley. They ran until 
the screaming faded. Then Fierce pulled 
up. Tigerheart slewed to a spot beside 
her. He dropped the grouse and gasped 
for breath as Ant, Cobweb, Dotty, and 
Blaze scrambled to a halt beside them. 
Rascal and Mittens turned and stared, 
still holding their fish. 


“What happened?” Fierce demanded 
as she dropped the hunk of meat she’d 
been holding. 

“Fog and her friends tried to steal 
the rabbit,” Tigerheart panted. 

“Why did you fight her?” Fierce 
looked indignant. “Now we can’t go 
back! The Twolegs will be looking out 
for us.” 

“Do you think I should have let her 
take the rabbit?” Tigerheart stared at her. 
“There was plenty for everyone!” 

“Then why did she want our 
rabbit?” Frustration flared in 
Tigerheart’s chest. When would Fierce 
understand that Fog wanted what the 
guardian cats owned and that she 


wouldn’t stop until she had driven them 
away? Just like Darktail. 

The guardian cats looked at one 
another uncertainly. 

“Tt is strange that she didn’t just find 
her own scraps,” Cobweb murmured. 

“Why did she have to take 
Tigerheart’s catch?” Rascal agreed. 

Fierce glared at the tabby tom. 
“Probably because Tigerheart’s been 
trying to start a fight with her since he 
met her,” she snapped. “Perhaps that’s 
what warrior cats do.” 

Tigerheart met the tortoiseshell’s 
angry gaze unflinchingly. “Warriors 
believe that some things are worth 
fighting for.” 


Fierce turned away angrily. 
Suddenly she stiffened, her ear pricking. 
Tigerheart jerked his muzzle around to 
follow her gaze. Fog and her friends 
were padding down the alley toward 
them. 

Tigerheart glanced at Fierce, 
resentment seething beneath his pelt. He 
stepped aside as Fog reached them and 
let Fierce face the smoky she-cat. “Fine. 
Why don’t I let you handle this?” 





CHAPTER 22 
Cog 


Fierce eyed Fog warily as the gray she- 
cat stopped a muzzle-length from her 
nose. Tuna and Growler flanked her. 
Streak watched from behind with six 
more strays. 

“You realize we might never be able 
to go scavenging there again,” Fierce 
snapped. “The Twolegs will be looking 
out for us next time.” 

“Of course we will,” Fog sniffed. 
“Twolegs have memories like birds. 
They won’ t remember us now that we’ve 
left.” 

“You didn’t have to try and steal 


Tigerheart’s rabbit,” Fierce told her. “If 
you'd scavenged for your own scraps, 
we'd all have scraps to take home.” 

Fog glanced at the prey piled at the 
guardian cats’ paws. “We could still all 
have something to take home.” She 
licked her lips. 

Fierce’s fur bristled. “We caught this 
prey, fair and square. It’s for the cats at 
our camp.” 

Fog tipped her head as her gang 
fanned out around her. “But it looks so 
tasty.” 

“We'd have more of it if you hadn’t 
started a fight.” Fierce unsheathed her 
claws. 

Tigerheart’s chest swelled with 


hope. Was Fierce finally realizing that 
even city cats had to fight for what 
belonged to them? He looked from Fog’s 
ragged gang to the guardian cats. Fierce 
and her friends were outnumbered. 
Would they remember the battle moves 
he’d taught them? Doubt pricked in his 
pelt. If there was a fight, there would be 
wounds, and they might lose the food 
they’d stolen. Perhaps reason would sort 
this out. He padded between the two 
groups and looked from Fierce to Fog. 
“If Twolegs have such small memories,” 
he meowed to Fog, “why don’t you go 
back and get some scraps of your own? 
I’m sure you can find better prey than 
this. Besides’”—he flicked his gaze to 


her companions—“‘this won’t be enough 
to feed all your bellies.” 

Fog narrowed her eyes. “Why don’t 
you give us your scraps and you can go 
and find more?” 

“No.” Fierce’s mew surprised 
Tigerheart. The tortoiseshell bushed out 
her fur. “Why are you bullying us? What 
did we ever do to you?” 

Fog looked amused. “Why do you 
need to have done anything to us? We’re 
just a bunch of cold, hungry cats looking 
for food and somewhere warm to sleep.” 

“We said you could sleep near the 
gathering place,” Fierce snapped. “Isn’t 
that enough? Why don’t you leave us in 
peace?” 


Tigerheart pricked his ears. He 
wanted to hear Fog’s answer. 

“I told you,” Fog meowed. “We 
were driven out of our home by foxes. It 
was a good home. A nice deserted 
stretch of scrub between some broken 
Twoleg dens. Lots of shelter, lots of 
prey. But now it belongs to foxes, and 
we need somewhere new to live.” 

Unease wormed though Tigerheart’s 
fur. If this went on, would Fog want to 
take over the guardian cats’ home as 
well as steal their food? He stared at 
her, fluffing out his fur to look bigger. 
“Pm a warrior,” he growled, “so 
fighting us for this food won’t be as easy 
as you think. I’m sorry you’ve lost your 


home, but this is a big city. Maybe you 
should look elsewhere for somewhere to 
live.” He unsheathed his claws and 
stared at the scratches he’d left on her 
muzzle. “I fought three of you earlier and 
I don’t have a single wound. And I’ve 
taught these cats how to fight like 
warriors too.” 

Fog exchanged a look with Tuna. 
Tigerheart was relieved to see worry 
pass between them. Pressing his 
advantage, he leaned closer. “If you 
want to start a fight, go ahead.” He 
lashed his tail. “But it won’t end here. 
Don’t forget, you decided to make your 
home next to ours. I can promise that if 
you try to take this food from us, you 


won’t ever sleep easily in your nests 
again.” He showed his teeth and let his 
breath bathe Fog’s muzzle. 

She backed away. “Okay,” she 
snarled. “We’ll go and find better prey 
than this.” Flicking her tail, she turned 
away. 

Tuna glared at Tigerheart 
menacingly, then followed. Growler 
showed his teeth. One by one, her ragged 
crew padded after her. 

Tigerheart turned on Fierce. “Do you 
see now why every cat needs borders?” 

Fierce bristled. “We don’t all dream 
of being a warrior. We’re healers, not 
fighters, and we managed to live in 
peace before you arrived. Not every 


argument needs to be settled with 
claws.” She picked up her hunk of meat 
and headed away. Cobweb, Ant, 
Mittens, and Rascal avoided his gaze as 
they followed with their catch. 

We managed to live in peace before 
you arrived. Tigerheart flexed his claws 
angrily. You didn’t have to deal with 
Fog before I arrived. How could Fierce 
be so shortsighted? Didn’t she realize 
that the more she appeased Fog, the 
bolder Fog would become? 

“I want to be a warrior.” Blaze’s 
mew took Tigerheart by surprise. 

He blinked at the young tom, who 
was puffing out his chest. “I’m glad it’s 
not just me.” 


Dovewing leaned closer to 
Tigerheart as they lay beside their nest, 
their bellies full of grouse, while the kits 
chased one another around the legs of the 
wooden ledge. “Did something happen 
while you were out?” 

“Only what I told you.” Tigerheart 
had recounted their encounter with Fog’s 
gang. He still hadn’t told her about the 
worry nagging deep in his belly. City 
cats had no code at all. From what he’d 
seen, they were hardly better than 
rogues. He didn’t want his kits to grow 
up thinking the way they did. 

Outside the gathering-place den, the 
sky darkened as night drew in. The clear 
stretches of wall shimmered in the 


orange light from the Twoleg dens. 

“Tigerheart.” Shadowkit clawed his 
way onto his father’s back. “Can you 
give me a bodger ride?” 

“Me too!” Pouncekit jumped up 
beside her brother. 

Lightkit scrambled on. “And me.” 

Tigerheart winced at the prick of 
their tiny claws. “It’s not a bodger ride,” 
he corrected. “It’s a badger ride.” He 
pushed himself to his paws, lurching a 
little to make them squeal, and began to 
stomp across the shiny floor. 

“What is a badger?” Lightkit asked. 

“I told you.” Tigerheart paused to let 
them settle, then staggered forward 
suddenly. The kits squealed again and 


clung on harder. “A badger is a big 
black-and-white creature that lives near 
the forest. It has a huge muzzle and 
beady eyes, and it eats kits if it catches 
them.” 

“Why didn’t a badger eat you?” 
Pouncekit demanded. 

“I never got caught,” Tigerheart told 
him. 

“Did a badger ever chase you?” 
Pouncekit pressed. 

“I fought one once,” Tigerheart told 
her. 

“You fought one?” Shadowkit’s gasp 
ruffled his ear fur. 

“I was with two Clanmates,” 
Tigerheart meowed. “Three warriors 


against one badger, and it still nearly 
won.” 

“How did you beat it?” Lightkit 
mewed breathlessly. 

Tigerheart turned sharply. The kits 
squeaked and scrabbled deeper into his 
fur. “I had to use all my best warrior 
moves,” he told them. “And I had my 
Clanmates by my side. When it saw the 
three of us lined up in front of its muzzle, 
it wailed in terror and ran away.” 

“You scared a badger away!” 
Lightkit tugged at his pelt. 

“You’re the best warrior ever,” 
Pouncekit squeaked. 

Shadowkit slid off his back and 
hurried back to Dovewing. “Will we 


have to fight badgers one day?” he asked 
her. 

She nuzzled his ear affectionately. 
“Perhaps,” she mewed. “But so long as 
you have Clanmates fighting at your side, 
you'll be safe.” 

Tigerheart tipped Lightkit and 
Pouncekit onto the floor with a shrug. 

Pouncekit tried to cling on. “Don’t 
stop!” 

“Its getting late,” he meowed firmly. 
“You should go to sleep.” 

“But I want to hear more about 
badgers!” Lightkit protested. 

Dovewing got to her paws and 
nudged the brown tabby kit toward the 
nest. “If you go to sleep, we’ll tell you 


about hawks tomorrow.” 

“Whats a hawk?” Lightkit stopped 
at the edge of the nest as Shadowkit and 
Pouncekit scrambled in. 

“Its a bird with a huge, sharp beak 
made of claws,” Dovewing mewed. 

Lightkit leaped down beside her 
littermates. “It sounds scary.” 

“Tt is.’ Dovewing nuzzled them 
down into the soft folds of the furless 
pelts, then padded back to Tigerheart. 
She settled beside him as he lay down 
on his belly and began to wash his paws. 
“It’s so nice being together without the 
Clans judging us,” she mewed absently. 

Tigerheart stopped washing. Why 
had she said that? Did she prefer it here? 


She nudged his shoulder with her 
nose. “It is, isn’t it?” 

He met her green gaze and tried to 
read it. Was she about to tell him that 
she’d changed her mind? Did she want 
to stay in the city? “I guess,” he 
murmured. 

“Sneaking around never felt right.” 
She turned her gaze toward the guardian 
cats who were moving around the 
shadowy den. Spire padded between the 
nests of the two new sick cats. Fierce 
washed her chest. Ant and Cobweb were 
still gnawing on the meaty bone they’d 
stolen, while Rascal and Mittens picked 
fish bones from their teeth. Blaze was 
already sleeping in his nest, tired out 


from the day’s adventure. 

Tigerheart looked at Dovewing. Was 
she wondering what it would be like to 
live here forever? “When we go home,” 
he meowed pointedly, “we won’t have 
to sneak around. We can be honest. We 
just need to decide which Clan we want 
to raise our kits in.” 

“I guess it will have to be 
ShadowClan,” Dovewing sighed. “I 
can’t ask you to give up your chance to 
be the leader of your Clan.” 

“I might not have a chance anymore.” 
For the first time, Tigerheart wondered 
with a sickening jolt if he’d been 
replaced as ShadowClan’s deputy. He 
had, after all, deserted them. 


Dovewing sniffed. “Who else could 
lead ShadowClan? You said that your 
Clanmates were begging you to lead 
them before you left. Of course you have 
a chance.” 

Tigerheart eyed her nervously. She 
was still gazing across the den. Was she 
testing him? Was he meant to say that he 
would give it up? 

She turned and caught his eye. “I 
know how important it is to you. I want 
you to be happy.” 

“So you'll join ShadowClan?” Hope 
flickered in his chest. 

“I guess.” She didn’t sound 
convinced. “If  there’s still a 
ShadowClan to join.” 


He tensed. Jt $ dark in the forest. He 
remembered Shadowkit’s words and 
shivered. Stop it! He was seeing 
prophecies everywhere. Even in the 
words of a kit. 

Dovewing went on. “But we don’t 
have to worry about that now. We can 
worry about it when the kits are old 
enough to travel.” 

When will that be? He didn’t dare 
ask, but he felt they should leave soon. 
She was so wrapped up in her love for 
their kits, perhaps going home wasn’t 
important to her anymore. Perhaps their 
safety was the only thing she cared 
about. He glanced toward the nest, 
where the kits had settled into silence. 


They must be asleep already. Perhaps 
she was right. His heart ached with love 
for Dovewing, Lightkit, Pouncekit, and 
Shadowkit. He should put their interests 
first. But wasn’t getting them back to the 
Clan so that they could grow up 
surrounded by warriors just as important 
as keeping them safe? If they didn’t 
become warriors, what would they 
become? 

Dovewing’s breath deepened beside 
him, and he realized she had dozed off. 
He pressed closer against her. It would 
all be okay. He had Dovewing and his 
kits, and one day he’d have his Clan 
again. 

He looked up at a clear stretch of 


wall, hoping to spy starlight piercing the 
harsh Twoleg light. A shadow moved 
beyond the stone. Tigerheart stiffened. A 
face was peering into the den. He 
recognized the wide ears and pointed 
muzzle. Fog. She was spying on the 
guardian cats. Fear quivered in his belly. 
Was she planning her next move? Did 
she have an eye on the cozy den the 
guardian cats had made for themselves 
beneath the gathering place? 

I have to stop her. Tigerheart knew 
that, whether they left this place or not, 
he had to make sure these cats were safe 
from Fog and her gang. 

His thoughts flitted as he watched 
Fog’s silhouette move along the stretch 


of clear wall. How could he drive her 
away? An idea sparked in his mind. 
Perhaps there was no need to drive her 
away. She might be happy to return to 
her old home if he could figure out how 
to get rid of the foxes that had stolen it. 





CHAPTER 23 
Cog 


“We’d need to find out how many foxes 
live there before we make a move.” 
Fierce paced the shiny floor of the 
gathering-place den. 

“Of course,” Tigerheart agreed. “But 
if we can get Fog and her gang to join us 
in the fight, I think we can drive them 
away.” 

He’d called a meeting the next 
morning, as soon as the guardian cats 
began to stir. Pouncekit, Lightkit, and 
Shadowkit watched from their nest. They 
stared with round, dark eyes, their ears 
pricked. Dovewing had given them strict 


instructions to keep quiet while the older 
cats talked. She stood beside Cobweb 
now, her gaze fixed on Fierce. 
Tigerheart had told her about his plan. 
He could sense Dovewing silently 
urging him on, but the guardian cats 
werent enthusiastic. Although Blaze 
watched curiously, Peanut and Bracken 
listened anxiously, their pelts prickling. 
Ant frowned, shifting his paws uneasily. 
Dotty, Pipsqueak, and Boots glanced at 
one another as he went on. “Fog is only 
going to make our life difficult if she 
stays,” he told them. “Last night, I saw 
her looking into our den.” He nodded 
toward the clear stretch of wall. “Her 
cats are not going to sleep outside in this 


weather if they think they can sleep in 
here.” 

Dotty looked puzzled. “Why don’t 
we invite them to join our group?” 

Tigerheart’s hackles lifted as he 
remembered Darktail. “Fog believes in 
every cat looking after himself. Her 
denmates probably feel the same. Do 
you want cats here who are only 
interested in filling their own bellies?” 
He flicked his muzzle toward the nests 
where Feather and Scowl, their newest 
patients, lay. Spire was stripping herbs 
from their stems beside them. “I’ve met 
cats like Fog before. In the forest, we 
call them rogues. They have no pity for 
sick cats. They see them as burdens. 


Inviting Fog to join this group would 
destroy everything you’ ve built here!” 

Fierce listened thoughtfully. “But you 
think, if we can drive the foxes away, 
Fog and her friends would go home?” 

“Yes.” Tigerheart ignored the doubt 
pricking in his belly. “They liked their 
old home. I think they’d choose it over 
this place if they could.” 

Pipsqueak’s tail twitched. “Just 
because we chased a pair of foxes from 
the herb patch doesn’t mean that we can 
fight a whole clan of them.” 

“We don’t know that it is a whole 
clan,” Tigerheart argued. 

“Tt was enough to drive away Fog 
and her cats,” Rascal commented darkly. 


“But if we fought together . . .” He 
looked pleadingly around the guardian 
cats. “With Fog fighting with us instead 
of against us, we could do it. I could 
offer to show them the battle moves I 
taught you.” 

Fierce blinked at him. “First you tell 
us Fog’s cats are a threat; then you offer 
to teach them how to fight?” 

Dovewing padded forward and 
stood beside Tigerheart. “Tigerheart’s 
only trying to help. He speaks from 
experience. Rogues drove his Clan from 
their home. He had to fight to get it back. 
His Clan still hasn’t really recovered.” 

“Why is he here, then?” Dotty looked 
at him through narrowed eyes. “Doesn’t 


his Clan need him?” 

Guilt sparked in Tigerheart’s chest. 
“Pm here because I think my Clan is 
better off without me for a while.” 

Dovewing shifted beside him. “And 
because he wants to be with me and our 
kits.” 

Dotty tipped her head toward 
Dovewing. “Why did you come?” she 
asked. “You talk about the Clans like 
they’re better than strays. Why did you 
leave them?” 

Tigerheart felt Dovewing’s fur 
bristle self-consciously. He met Dotty’s 
inquisitive stare. “She dreamed that her 
kits would be safer here.” 

Dotty rolled her eyes. “She sounds 


like Spire.” 

Spire lifted his head. Herb specks 
were caught in his whiskers. “Dreams 
sometimes reveal the truth.” He nodded 
distractedly at Dovewing and Tigerheart. 
“I dreamed they would come, didn’t I?” 

“Dreams are nonsense,” Dotty 
huffed. “What does it matter if Spire 
dreamed you were coming? It doesn’t 
change anything.” 

As she spoke, Rascal and Mittens 
squeezed through the entrance and 
jumped to the floor. Mittens’s eyes 
glittered with alarm. Rascal’s pelt was 
ruffled. 

“There are cat scents around the 
slabs,” Mittens mewed breathlessly. 


Fierce stiffened. “Fog’s cats?” 

Mittens nodded. “They’ve clearly 
been snooping around in the night.” 

“And there are Twoleg scents too,” 
Rascal added. “Fresh ones. They must 
have come before dawn.” 

Tigerheart lifted his muzzle. “Fog’s 
group is clearly attracting the attention of 
the Twolegs, just like they did at the 
outdoor gathering. We need to get rid of 
her before the Twolegs discover our 
den.” 

Fierce gazed at him thoughtfully for a 
moment and then nodded. “Let’s practice 
those battle moves you taught us,” she 
meowed decisively. 

Pipsqueak’s pelt bristled nervously. 


“Are we going to fight the foxes?” 

“Not until we know how many there 
are and if Fog will help us,” Fierce told 
him. “But it sounds as though we are 
going to have to defend our home one 
way or another, so we might as well be 
ready.” 

The guardian cats looked at one 
another. Tigerheart’s paws pricked 
nervously as they leaned close and 
murmured. One by one, they met Fierce’s 
gaze and nodded. 

Hope swelled in Tigerheart’s belly. 
He was doing what was best for the 
group. He couldn’t let Fog drive them 
away. “We should train outside,” he 
suggested. “We need to get used to 


fighting on uneven ground.” He swept 
his tail over the shiny floor. “And I hope 
the battle never reaches this den.” 

He let Fierce lead the way out. 
Pipsqueak, Dotty, Rascal, and Mittens 
followed, Ant and Cobweb at their tails. 
As Bracken, Boots, and Peanut headed 
after them, Tigerheart called them back. 

“You're healers,’ he meowed. 
“Perhaps you should be gathering herbs 
for the wounded rather than training how 
to fight.” He searched their gazes. He 
didn’t want to frighten them, but if there 
was a battle, they would need to be 
prepared. 

Peanut nodded. “We’ll go to the herb 
patch now,” she mewed. “There may be 


some leaves left untouched by the frost.” 

As she led Boots and Bracken out, 
Dovewing glanced at  Pouncekit, 
Lightkit, and Shadowkit. They were still 
watching, leaning forward eagerly. 
Dovewing purred. “They’re desperate to 
help.” 

Tigerheart blinked fondly at them. 
“Perhaps they could watch the battle 
training.” It would be almost like being 
among real warriors. 

Dovewing’s ears twitched anxiously. 
“You mean, take them outside?” 

“Just as far as the stone slabs,” 
Tigerheart encouraged. “Fresh air will 
do them good. And there won’t be any 
Twolegs around. It’s not a yowling day.” 


“What about the Twolegs Rascal 
smelled?” 

“They must be gone. He didn’t see 
them. He only caught their scent.” 
Tigerheart felt a prick of guilt. Would 
Dovewing guess that he was eager to get 
the kits outside because he wanted them 
to taste the wind and feel soft grass 
beneath their paws? He wanted to know 
if the leaf-bare wind would pierce their 
kit fluff too easily. Would the cold earth 
freeze their pads? Were they ready to 
make the journey home? 

She looked at him uncertainly, and 
then at the kits. 

Pouncekit was already racing across 
the shiny floor. “Did Tigerheart say we 


could go out?” 

Lightkit charged after her sister. “I 
want to go first.” 

“Won't it be cold outside?” 
Shadowkit trailed them doubtfully. 

“Thats what you’ve got fur for, 
silly! Pouncekit called over her 
shoulder. 

Dovewing’s tail drooped. “I guess 
we can take them out,” she conceded. 
“But only for a while.” 

Lightkit tried to haul herself up the 
leg of the wooden ledge. Dovewing 
scooped her up and carried her up to the 
entrance. “Don’t go outside until P ve got 
Shadowkit and Pouncekit,” she warned. 
As she jumped down to fetch them, 


Tigerheart noticed Spire. The healer had 
wandered into a pool of sunshine at the 
far end of the den and was staring at the 
air, his eyes glazed. Was he having a 
vision? 

“PII join you in a moment,” 
Tigerheart called to Dovewing as she 
dropped Shadowkit beside his 
littermates. 

“Don’t be long,’ Dovewing 
answered, nosing them through the gap in 
the wall. 

Tigerheart padded toward the skinny 
black tom. Spire didn’t shift his gaze 
from the shaft of light that seemed to 
have hypnotized him. Tigerheart 
wondered whether to disturb him, but as 


he neared, Spire spoke, his gaze still 
distant. 

“Take care of Blaze.” 

For a moment, Tigerheart wondered 
who the healer was talking to, but there 
was no cat left in the den aside from 
Feather and Scowl, and they were 
hidden among the furless pelts of their 
nests. Was he talking to an imaginary 
cat? 

“I will not live beside the 
widewater. But Blaze will.” 

Widewater? Instantly Tigerheart 
thought of the lake. Was he talking about 
their journey there? “Are you saying 
Blaze will travel home with us?” 

Spire’s yellow gaze flashed toward 


him, focusing suddenly. “Of course.” 

Hes talking to me. Tigerheart 
leaned closer. “So widewater means the 
lake?” 

“That’s where the Clans live, isn’t 
it?” 

“Yes.” Surprise set Tigerheart’s fur 
prickling. “How do you know?” Had 
Dovewing mentioned the lake? 

“I told you.” Spire shook out his 
pelt. “I see things.” 

“Do you see our journey? Do we 
make it home safely?” 

Spire looked away. “Go teach battle 
moves, like you promised.” 

Unease wormed in Tigerheart’s 
belly. The healer was avoiding his 


question. “Do you know if we get home 
safely?” he pressed. 

Spire padded past him, heading for 
the sick cats’ nests. “I don’t see 
everything,” he meowed briskly. 

Tigerheart hurried from the den, 
suddenly anxious to see Dovewing and 
their kits. Did the black tom know 
something? Something he didn’t dare 
tell? 

Pouncekit, Lightkit, and Shadowkit 
were bouncing over the grass beside a 
stone slab. Dovewing watched them 
protectively, her gaze flitting beyond 
them, as though checking for danger. She 
caught sight of him and blinked at him, 
purring. “They like the grass.” 


“Its so soft,” Lightkit squeaked. 

“And tickly.” Pouncekit rolled over 
in it, mewling with delight. 

Shadowkit stayed in the shelter of 
the slab and watched anxiously. 

“I want to explore,’ Pouncekit 
mewed. 

“I want to play.” Lightkit called to 
Tigerheart. “Are you going to play with 
us?” 

Tigerheart looked to where the 
guardian cats were already practicing 
the battle moves he’d taught them to fight 
foxes. “I have to go and help Fierce,” he 
told Lightkit. “We can play another 
time.” 

Lightkit wasn’t listening. She was 


following Pouncekit as the gray kit 
sniffed her way to the next stone slab 
like a fox following scent. 

Tigerheart purred. It was good to see 
the kits with grass beneath their paws 
and sky overhead. For the first time, he 
could imagine them as warriors. He 
turned toward the guardian cats. 
Cobweb and Ant were stalking around 
Rascal. Rascal eyed them sharply. As 
Cobweb dived for Rascal’s forepaw and 
Ant lunged for his tail, Rascal ducked 
and rolled. Cobweb and Ant landed 
clumsily as Rascal tumbled out of reach. 

“Nice move, Rascal! Tigerheart 
was pleased the guardian cats had 
remembered the skills he’d taught them. 


Blaze bounded toward him. “I want 
to learn a new move!” he mewed. “I 
already know all the old ones.” 

“You do, do you?” Tigerheart purred 
at him proudly. “Show me one.” 

Blaze arched his back and flattened 
his ears. Hissing, he approached 
Tigerheart side-first, looking as big as 
he could. Tigerheart shot out a paw to 
tumble the kit onto his back, but his 
sheathed claws swiped thin air. Blaze 
had ducked beneath his chest and was 
clinging to his hind leg, churning his 
paws against it energetically. 

“Very good!” Tigerheart purred. 
“You're a natural fighter.” 

“I am?” Blaze leaped to his paws 


and stared excitedly at Tigerheart. 

Tigerheart cuffed his ear playfully. 
You’ve a long way to go before you’d 
make a warrior. But the kit definitely 
had talent. He was quick-thinking as 
well as fast. 

Movement near the trees caught his 
eye. Fog and Tuna were stalking through 
the grass there. Streak and Growler 
were heading the other way. They’re 
still checking out our territory. 
Tigerheart’s pelt prickled. He wished 
the guardian cats would admit this was 
their land and mark some borders. It 
would make it easier to challenge Fog 
and her gang. And yet how could he 
confront her now? He needed her to help 


them fight the foxes. As Fog caught his 
eye, he looked away. Focus on training 
the guardian cats. 

Fierce lifted her muzzle. “What do 
we do if we’re attacked by two foxes at 
once?” 

Tigerheart flicked his tail 
approvingly. She was thinking like a 
warrior. “If we fight the foxes, we’ll 
stay in pairs. That way we can be more 
prepared for an attack on two sides.” He 
beckoned Rascal and Mittens forward. 
“Stand tail to tail,” he told them. As they 
shifted into position, he padded around 
the circle of watching cats and nudged 
Pipsqueak forward with his nose. “You 
can be one fox,” he mewed, then moved 


on to Dotty. “You can be the other.” He 
guided her past Rascal and Mittens, who 
were facing outward, their tails 
touching. “If two foxes attack from two 
sides, get straight into a tail-to-tail 
position. Foxes will instinctively go for 
your legs. Duck down and claw their 
muzzle as they come in for the attack. 
Aim for their eyes if you can. Then rear 
up fast, so your backs are touching, and 
use each other to push off. Leap clear of 
the fox’s muzzle, onto its back. The foxes 
will crash into each other while you’ve 
got your claws around their spines. Try 
it.” Tigerheart stepped back to watch. 
“Remember,” he told Pipsqueak and 
Dotty, “you’re foxes. Aim for their legs. 


Everybody, keep your claws sheathed. 
We don’t want injuries.” 

He watched, concentrating, as Dotty 
and Pipsqueak circled Rascal and 
Mittens. 

“Keep your faces toward the fox at 
all times,” Tigerheart warned. “When 
youre fighting large enemies, your teeth 
and claws are more important than your 
strength.” 

Rascal and Mittens shifted to keep 
their muzzles pointed toward Pipsqueak 
and Dotty as they continued to circle. 
Then Dotty caught Pipsqueak’s eye and 
lunged forward. Pipsqueak followed. 
Rascal and Mittens threw a flurry of 
blows at their denmates’ muzzles, then 


reared together and pushed away from 
each other. They sailed over their 
attackers, flattening them as they landed 
squarely on their backs. 

Pipsqueak grunted as his paws 
collapsed beneath him. “Rascal, you’re 
heavy!” He wriggled indignantly from 
under the tabby tom. 

Dotty scrambled from under Mittens. 
“Tt seems like a good strategy.” 

“Let’s all practice it.” Fierce waved 
Ant, Cobweb, Blaze, and Rascal into 
group with a flick of her tail. 

Cobweb hesitated, his gaze flicking 
toward Blaze. “He’s too young to fight 
foxes,” he pointed out. 

“He wont be involved in any 


battles,” Fierce promised. “But he might 
as well learn the moves. He might need 
them one day—” 

The terrified squeal of a kit cut her 
off. 

Tigerheart froze. Pouncekit! He 
recognized her cry. Heart bursting with 
terror, he raced for the patch of grass 
where he’d left them. The kits were 
gone. He saw Dovewing’s pelt flash 
between the stone slabs and chased after 
her. 

He caught up as she reached a shiny 
mesh cave, which sat in the grass behind 
a stone. Pouncekit was trapped inside, 
staring through the silver mesh, her eyes 
wide with horror. 


“What happened?” Dovewing 
pressed her muzzle against the mesh. 

Pouncekit pushed the tip of her nose 
through a gap and mewled pitifully into 
her mother’s cheek fur. “I smelled 
something tasty. And I crept inside to get 
it. But it banged shut behind me.” 

Shadowkit and Lightkit scrabbled at 
the outside with their paws. 

“She’s trapped!” Lightkit squealed. 

“Its eaten her.” Shadowkit looked at 
Tigerheart, his eyes dark and round. 
“She’s trapped forever!” 





CHAPTER 24 
Cog 


Tigerheart sniffed the edges of the 
cave. “Which end was open?” he asked 
Pouncekit. 

“The small end behind me,” 
Pouncekit wailed. 

“Its okay, dear,” Dovewing crooned 
softly. “We’ll get you out.” She glanced 
at Tigerheart. Guilt glittered in her green 
eyes. “She was only away from me for a 
moment.” 

“She’ll be okay.” Tigerheart hoped 
Dovewing couldn’t hear panic in his 
mew. His heartbeat pounded in his ears 
as he sniffed the small end and hooked a 


claw into the mesh. It was stuck firmly 
shut. 

Fierce, Cobweb, and Dotty reached 
them. 

“What is that?” Dotty stared in 
horror at the mesh cave. 

“Tt must be some kind of Twoleg 
trap,” Fierce growled. “I can smell their 
stench on it.” 

“That’s what they were doing in the 
night,” Cobweb gasped. “Setting this 
trap.” 

A monster rumbled nearby. 
Tigerheart looked up and saw it stop at 
the edge of the grass. A Twoleg got out, 
headed toward the smooth path that led 
to the  gathering-place entrance. 


Tigerheart felt sick. Was it coming to 
claim its trap with Pouncekit inside? 
Relief flickered in his chest as the 
Twoleg headed around the back of the 
gathering place. “We’ve got to hurry,” he 
meowed. “That Twoleg might come 
back.” 

Dotty had pulled Lightkit and 
Shadowkit against her belly and was 
soothing them with gentle laps of her 
tongue, while Dovewing comforted 
Pouncekit through the mesh. Her eyes 
were still wide, but her breathing was 
slowing as Dovewing nuzzled her cheek. 

Cobweb crouched beside Tigerheart 
and examined the trap. “There’s a gap,” 
he mewed. “Where the edges meet.” He 


hooked a claw into it and tugged. It 
shifted, but not much. He strained harder. 
“Tt’s stiff, but I think we can get it open if 
we can find something to wedge in.” 

“A stick,” Fierce suggested. She 
darted away toward a tree. 

Tigerheart glanced at Dovewing. Her 
gaze was fixed on Pouncekit as she 
whispered reassurance through the mesh. 
“Just hold still a bit longer. We’re 
getting you out.” 

“We’ve got a plan,” Tigerheart told 
her. 

She met his gaze, fright flashing in 
her eyes, then turned back to Pouncekit. 

Fierce raced back, a stick between 
her jaws. “This end is thin,” she 


meowed as she dropped it beside 
Tigerheart. “But the other end is thick.” 

Cobweb sniffed it. “If we feed the 
thin end through, we can wedge it open.” 

Tigerheart understood, hope flaring 
beneath his fur. “If we push it all the way 
inside, up to the thick end, it might be 
strong enough to move the mesh.” 

Fierce picked up the stick again and 
threaded the thin end through the gap 
while Tigerheart and Cobweb pulled at 
the mesh with their claws. 

“Move out of the way, Pouncekit,” 
Tigerheart warned as Fierce pushed the 
stick deeper into the trap. 

Pouncekit squeezed against the side, 
trembling as Dovewing nuzzled her 


through the mesh. She stared, wide-eyed, 
as the stick nudged past her. “Will it 
work?” 

“I hope so,” Tigerheart muttered, 
straining at the trap. His claws burned 
with the effort. The stick was deep 
inside now, its thicker end holding the 
gap open wide enough to squeeze a paw 
through. “Pull on the stick,” he told 
Fierce. 

Digging her paws into the grass, 
Fierce tugged on the stick. The thin end 
caught in the mesh, and she began slowly 
to lever the small end open. 

“Its working!” Dovewing pricked 
her ears as the gap widened. “Go on, 
Pouncekit, squeeze through. But be 


99 


quick.” 

Pouncekit darted to the opening and 
wriggled through like a mouse squeezing 
beneath a root. As she bundled out, the 
stick snapped. Fierce fell backward and 
the trap slammed shut. 

Tigerheart got his claws out of the 
way just in time. Cobweb hopped 
nimbly to one side. 

“Pouncekit!” With a gasp, Dovewing 
leaped to the kit’s side, her gaze flitting 
toward the gray kit’s tail. Tigerheart 
stiffened. Had the trap bitten her as it 
closed? His shoulders sagged with relief 
as Pouncekit fluffed out her fur happily. 

“Pm okay!” She flung herself against 
her mother’s belly and nuzzled hard into 


her fur. 

“I knew they were too young to be 
outside,” Dovewing fretted. “It’s 
dangerous.” She glared accusingly at 
Tigerheart. “How could you think of 
making them travel through a city when 
they’re so young?” 

“I never said—” Tigerheart stared at 
her, searching for words. He’d only 
thought about the journey home. He’d 
never mentioned it. He held his tongue 
now. Dovewing had been frightened. 
The trap had shocked them all. With cold 
certainty that sat like stone in his belly, 
he knew that it was far too soon to make 
the kits travel. 

Just seeing them near the dens and 


Thunderpaths made him realize how 
small and vulnerable they were. And 
even if they made it out of the city, fields 
and forests might be more dangerous. In 
the Clans, didn’t queens keep their kits 
in camp until they were six moons old to 
protect them from the owls and foxes 
that might carry them off? He returned 
Dovewing’s gaze evenly. “You’re right. 
They are too young to travel.” He 
blinked at Fierce, his thoughts spinning. 
“Have you seen these traps before?” 

“Never.” Fierce poked it warily with 
her paw. 

Lightkit looked out from below 
Dotty’s belly. “Are the Twolegs trying to 
hurt us?” 


“I don’t know.” Tigerheart frowned. 
Why had the Twolegs decided to leave 
such a dangerous thing now? He glanced 
toward the trees beyond the slabs where 
Fog and her gang had made their nests. 
Had too many cats caught the Twolegs’ 
attention? “But I think they might be 
trying to catch us.” He’d heard nursery 
tales about cats carried off by Twolegs 
and forced to live as kittypets. He 
shuddered. 

A terrified wail sounded at the far 
end of the gathering den. The Twoleg 
had appeared from behind it and was 
carrying a mesh trap. White fur flashed 
inside. Paws scrabbled against the mesh 
as the trapped cat wailed again. 


Tigerheart recognized the anguished face 
of Streak. 

“No!” Fog stared from beside the 
den wall, her face twisted with grief as 
she watched the Twoleg carry the trap to 
its monster and shut it inside. 

“Quick.” Tigerheart nudged 
Dovewing toward the den. “We need to 
hide. It might be coming for this trap. It 
mustn’t find us here.” 

Dovewing scooped up Pouncekit by 
the scruff. Cobweb picked up Lightkit. 
Dotty grabbed Shadowkit. Keeping low, 
they scurried toward the den entrance. 
Fierce waved Mittens, Rascal, and the 
others toward the gathering place with a 
flick of her tail. As the cats streamed 


toward their home and began to file 
inside, Tigerheart watched Fog. The 
gray she-cat was staring desperately at 
the monster where Streak was trapped 
while the Twoleg headed toward 
Pouncekit’s trap. It grunted angrily as it 
picked up the mesh cave. Tigerheart 
guessed it wasn’t pleased to find the trap 
closed but empty. 

As the last of the guardian cats 
followed Dovewing and Dotty inside, he 
slid into the shadow of the gathering-den 
wall and crept to where Fog stood as 
rigid as stone. “Don’t let the Twoleg see 
you,” he hissed. “It might take you too.” 
He nudged her backward until a jutting 
wall blocked the Twoleg’s view. 


“Tt stole Streak!” Fog’s eyes were 
wide with disbelief. “He’s my brother. 
They can’t take him!” 

Tigerheart stared at her, his heart 
aching with pity. 

“We've got to rescue him.” She 
lurched forward, but he blocked her 
way. 

“We can’t,’ he meowed flatly. 
“There’s nothing we can do.” 

Fog turned her stricken gaze on him. 
“You've traveled. You’re a warrior. You 
must have seen this happen before. You 
must know where the Twolegs take the 
cats they steal!” Her pelt bristled with 
alarm. “Tell me where they’re taking 
him!” 


“I don’t know.” Tigerheart mewed 
helplessly. 

“T can’t lose Streak.” 

“He’ll be okay.” 

“How do you know that?” 

“They ll make him live like a 
kittypet. But eventually he’ll escape. 
Twolegs can’t stop a cat from leaving if 
he wants to leave. He’ll find his way 
back.” 

“What if they don’t make him a 
kittypet?” Fog’s grief was quickly 
hardening into rage. “What if they kill 
him?” 

The monster began to rumble. Fog 
darted from behind the wall and stared 
at it. Tigerheart padded after her and 


watched the monster pull away. 

“No!” 

Fog’s wail tore his heart. As the 
monster disappeared around a corner, 
she turned on him. “This is your fault!” 

“My fault?” Tigerheart blinked at 
her. 

“Why didn’t you tell us there were 
traps?” 

“I didn’t know.” 

Paw steps sounded beyond the wall. 
Tuna and Growler raced around the 
corner. They stopped in front of Fog. 

“Did it take him?” Tuna asked. 

Fog stared at him bleakly. “There 
was nothing I could do.” 

Growler glanced around nervously. 


“We’ve found more traps.” 

“More?” Fierce’s mew took 
Tigerheart by surprise. He turned to see 
the tortoiseshell padding toward them. 
Ant and Cobweb were following. 

“Are the kits hidden?” Tigerheart 
asked. 

Fierce nodded. “Even if the Twolegs 
found the den, they wouldn’t find the 
kits. There’s a lot of clutter to hide 
behind.” She turned to Growler. “Show 
us where these other traps are.” 

Growler headed across the grass, 
leading Fierce around the end of the 
gathering place. Tigerheart followed, 
Cobweb and Ant at his heels. 

He glanced back and saw Tuna 


weaving around Fog, trying to comfort 
her. 

“Here.” Growler led them to a mesh 
trap identical to the one that had caught 
Pouncekit. It sat behind a stone slab, one 
end wide open. The mouthwatering scent 
of fresh-kill wafted from inside. 
Tigerheart could see how Pouncekit had 
been tempted. 

“There’s another one over there.” 
Growler nodded toward the slabs a few 
rows away. Then he turned his muzzle 
toward the patch of trees. “And one near 
our camp.” 

Cobweb was leaning close to the 
trap, sniffing at it. 

“Don’t go inside,” Fierce warned. 


“Pm not a mouse-brain,” Cobweb 
answered. “I was just wondering how 
Pouncekit made her trap shut.” 

Tigerheart peered through the mesh. 
He could see the tasty fresh-kill wasn’t 
fresh-kill at all, but just mush smeared 
beyond a shiny strip that stuck up in the 
middle of the trap. “It’s not even real 
fresh-kill.” 

Cobweb’s gaze paused as it reached 
the shiny strip. “That part of the trap 
wasn’t sticking up in Pouncekit’s trap.” 

Ant’s ears pricked. “Do you think it 
went down when she stepped on it?” 

“And shut the trap!” Growler’s eyes 
shone. 

“Lets find out.” Cobweb hurried 


away toward a tree and returned 
carrying a stick. 

Tigerheart’s chest tightened as 
Cobweb poked the stick through the 
mesh and touched the end to the strip. 
The trap snapped shut. Tigerheart’s pelt 
bushed with alarm. 

Fierce blinked, her hackles lifting. 
“Twoleg fox-hearts!” 

Cobweb lifted his muzzle 
triumphantly. “Now we know how to 
close them!” 

Fierce padded away. “Come on. 
Let’s close the others.” 

“Let’s hurry!” Cobweb followed her, 
tail twitching anxiously. “The sound of 
the traps shutting seems to attract the 


Twolegs.” 

As they headed toward the next trap, 
Ant and Growler at their heels, 
Tigerheart paused. Fog had seen danger 
here. Now would be the best time to 
persuade her that they needed to do 
something about it... . He called after 
Fierce. “There’s something I must do.” 

She waved her tail in reply. Cobweb 
was already fetching a stick to close the 
next trap. Tigerheart turned and padded 
around the end of the gathering den. Fog 
was still standing beside Tuna, staring at 
where the monster had disappeared as 
though she could still hardly believe her 
eyes. 

Tigerheart dipped his head as he 


reached her. “I’m sorry for your loss,” 
he meowed gently. 

She turned on him. “You’re probably 
glad to see one of us gone,” she snapped. 

Tigerheart shifted his paws. He had 
to handle this conversation carefully. 
“Pm never glad to see a cat fall into 
Twoleg paws,” he meowed. “I’m a 
warrior. I believe all cats should live 
free.” He caught Tuna’s eye. “But now 
you see that this is a dangerous place to 
live.” Tuna shifted his paws. “Perhaps 
you and your friends would be safer in 
your old home.” 

“How could we be?” Fog demanded. 
“Tt’s full of foxes.” 

Tigerheart changed tack. “Did you 


see us training earlier?” 

“Do you call jumping around on the 
grass ‘training’?” Fog grunted. 

“We wondered what you were 
doing.” Tuna looked curious. 

“We were practicing battle moves, 
so we could drive the foxes away from 
your old home,” Tigerheart explained. 

“Battle moves?” Tuna tipped his 
head. 

“Where I come from, all cats learn 
how to fight,” Tigerheart told him. “We 
have to fight badgers and foxes and 
sometimes hawks. It takes special 
trainng to learn to fight bigger 
creatures.” 

Fog glared at him. “There are five 


foxes living in our camp. Do you think 
that bunch of featherbrains will be able 
to fight them?” 

Tigerheart felt his paws dig into the 
earth. Five foxes certainly sounded 
terrifying—but if he could convince Fog 
that he wasn’t scared, then maybe she’d 
believe that her cats stood a chance. “We 
could if you and your friends fought 
beside us.” He searched her gaze 
hopefully. 

Tuna glanced at her. “We'd 
outnumber them,” he meowed. 

“They're foxes!” Fog snapped. 
“They could strip the fur off your muzzle 
and crush your spine in their jaws.” 

“Not if I taught you how to fight.” 


Tigerheart’s chest tightened with hope. 
“And once you learned, you’d always be 
able to defend your land. You’d be safe 
forever.” 

Tuna blinked encouragingly at Fog. 
“Tt would be nice not to have to sleep in 
grass nests anymore.” 

“Tt would be nice to keep my pelt,” 
Fog growled. “I’m not risking it fighting 
foxes. Can’t you see? He’s trying to trick 
us.” She flicked her nose dismissively 
toward Tigerheart. “He wants us gone, 
and he’s willing to do anything to get rid 
of us, even if it means feeding us to 
foxes.” 

“Tt sounds like a good plan,” Tuna 
persisted. 


“It is a good plan,” Tigerheart 
pressed. “Two groups of trained cats 
could fight a whole pack of foxes.” 

“Really?” Fog sneered at him. “In 
that case, train your friends. Pm not 
risking mine. If you manage to drive the 
foxes away, we’ll go home.” 

Tigerheart’s belly twisted with 
disappointment, but he squared his 
shoulders. He wasn’t going to let this 
rogue-hearted stray think she’d won. 
“Do you promise?” 

Fog looked at him warily. “Promise 
what?” 

“That you'll leave here and go home 
if we drive away the foxes.” 

“Sure.” Fog turned her tail on him. “I 


promise.” 

He watched her walk away, his heart 
sinking. The guardian cats could never 
fight five foxes alone. If only there were 
another way to get rid of them... 





CHAPTER 25 
Cog 


“Fierce!” Mittenss  yowl woke 
Tigerheart. He jerked up his head as the 
tabby tom jumped down from the 
entrance. 

Dovewing opened her eyes and 
blinked anxiously at Tigerheart. “What is 
it?” 

“PII find out.” Tigerheart slid gently 
from beneath Shadowkit and Pouncekit, 
who were sleeping on his flank. They 
murmured but didn’t wake as Dovewing 
scooped them close to her belly. He 
climbed quietly out of his nest, fluffing 
out his fur as he stepped into the chilly 


air. Most of the guardian cats were still 
sleeping. Soft dawn light filtered thought 
the clear stretches of wall. Fierce sat up 
sleepily in her nest as Mittens reached it. 

The tabby glanced over his shoulder 
as Rascal squeezed through the entrance. 
“Did you find any more?” he called. 

“Three.” Rascal hurried to Fierce’s 
nest. 

“Find more what?” Fierce gazed 
blearily at the two toms. 

“Traps,” Rascal meowed. 

Tigerheart hurried to join them. 

“The Twolegs have been back,” 
Mittens reported. “Their scent is so 
fresh they must have only just left.” 

“They've taken all the traps we 


closed.” Rascals pelt __ prickled 
nervously. 

“They’ve left new ones,” Mittens 
told her. 

“Bigger ones this time,” Rascal 
chimed. 

“Big enough to trap a fox.” Mittens’s 
eyes were dark with worry. 

Tigerheart reached Fierce’s nest and 
glanced around the three cats. “Could 
we close them all again?” 

Mittens flicked his tail. “What good 
would that do? They’d only bring more.” 

Fierce gazed anxiously around the 
den. “Perhaps it’s time we moved on.” 

“Where to?” Mittens demanded. 
“This is the quietest part of the city.” 


Fierce’s pelt was still ruffled by 
sleep. It prickled along her spine. “I 
don’t know,” she mewed irritably. “I 
thought this place was safe.” 

“Tt was, until Fog and her gang 
arrived,” Rascal growled. “The Twolegs 
didn’t know we were here.” 

“We need to get rid of her,” Mittens 
grunted. 

Fierce looked at Tigerheart. “What 
about your plan to get her cats to help us 
fight the foxes?” 

Tigerheart shifted his paws. He 
hadn’t told the guardian cats about his 
conversation with Fog yet. “I asked her,” 
he confessed. “She said no. She said 
she’d go back to her old home if we 


drove off the foxes, but her cats won’t 
help us.” 

“Did you find out how many foxes 
there are?” Fierce asked. 

“Five,” Tigerheart told her. 

Mitten’s tail twitched angrily. “We 
can’t drive off five foxes alone!” 

Rascal looked up at a clear stretch of 
wall, narrowing his eyes against the light 
outside. “Perhaps we should fight Fog 
and her friends,” he grunted. 

“We should shove them into those 
traps and let the Twolegs take them 
away,” Mittens growled. 

Tigerheart twitched as a_ thought 
sparked in his mind. He wouldn’t drive 
any cat into the paws of Twolegs, but 


perhaps there was another way to use the 
traps. “We don’t have to give cats to the 
Twolegs,” he ventured. “But what if we 
gave them something else?” 

Fierce’s sleepy gaze sharpened 
suddenly. “Like what?” 

Tigerheart hesitated. This would be 
a dangerous plan, but if it worked, it 
could solve all the guardian cats’ 
problems. 

Fierce stepped out her nest and 
pricked her ears. “Well?” 

“If we can trick the foxes into the 
traps—” 

Mittens cut him off with a snort. 
“How could we do that?” 

Fierce flicked her tail at the tabby 


irritably. “Let him finish.” Her green 
eyes sparkled with interest. 

Tigerheart’s mind quickened as he 
traced out the plan. “We’d need to get 
Fog to show us where they are.” He 
hesitated, remembering Fog’s hostility 
yesterday. “Or Tuna. Yes. Tuna would 
show us.” The brown tom had wanted to 
go back to his old home. “Then we’d 
just need a small patrol to get the foxes 
to chase it. It could lead them here, and 
the rest of us could lead them into the 
traps.” 

Mitten’s pelt bristled. “They’d kill 
us.” 

“Cats are fast,” Tigerheart argued. 
“And we’d know where we were 


running. We could choose a route that 
would be hard for a fox’s clumsy paws.” 

Rascal looked unconvinced. “And 
what if we get them here and they don’t 
go into the traps? We’d have led foxes 
right to our home for nothing!” 

“We have enough cats here for two 
cats to take on each fox once they reach 
the gathering place.” Tigerheart pictured 
the stretch of grass around the den. 
“There are plenty of stone slabs to 
dodge around. Cats are nimble; foxes 
aren’t. We could easily confuse them 
until they don’t know where to run. Then 
we'd guide them to the traps. Even if we 
can’t drive them right inside, the scent of 
food might draw them in.” 


“That Twoleg mush does smell 
tempting,” Mittens conceded. 

“If my plan doesnt work,” 
Tigerheart went on, “we could just hide 
in the den. The entrance is too small for 
the foxes, and they won’t stay here. 
There’s not much for them to scavenge. 
They’d probably go back to their den. 
But if it does work, we’ll get rid of the 
foxes, and Fog’s cats. And with Fog’s 
cats gone, if we keep a low profile for a 
while, the Twolegs will think they’ve 
gotten rid of us and stop leaving traps.” 

Fierce looked from Rascal to 
Mittens. Her gaze was thoughtful. “There 
is a lot to gain.” 

“Its dangerous,” Mittens murmured. 


“I can lead the foxes here,” 
Tigerheart offered. “But P1 need some 
help.” 

“Pm fast, even if I run a little 
wonkily,” Fierce meowed, stretching out 
the leg that was shorter than the others. 
“PI help.” 

A mew sounded across the floor. 
Tigerheart turned. Ant was sitting up in 
his nest, his ears pricked. “P1 come.” 

Cobweb padded from the shadow of 
Twoleg clutter. “Me too.” 

Mittens and Rascal exchanged 
glances. 

“Okay.” Mittens sounded suddenly 
determined. “If you four lead the foxes 
here, Rascal and I will organize the rest 


of the group to lead them to the traps.” 
Excitement pricked in Tigerheart’s 
paws. The guardian cats were talking 
like warriors! “We can do this.” He 
whisked his tail encouragingly. All he 
had to do now was persuade Tuna to 
show them where his old camp was. 


“Tuna.” Tigerheart crouched in the 
long grass beside Fog’s camp. He 
glanced up at the sky. Dark clouds were 
swallowing the blue, and he smelled 
rain as the cold wind pierced his fur. He 
pricked his ears, hoping Tuna would 
hear him before any of the other cats. 
“Tuna,” he hissed again. 

“What do you want?” Growler nosed 
his way from the bushes. 


“I have a message for Tuna,” 
Tigerheart mewed. 

Growler narrowed his eyes. “You’re 
up to something,’ he meowed. “I’m 
going to fetch Fog. You can talk to her.” 

Tigerheart’s belly tightened. Fog 
might get in the way of his plan. “No,” 
he meowed quickly. “I just came to tell 
Tuna about the new traps. I wanted to 
show him where they were.” 

“You can show me.” As Growler 
glanced at the sky and shivered, Tuna 
peered from the bushes. 

He blinked at Tigerheart. “I thought I 
smelled you.” 

Tigerheart tried to hide his eagerness 
at seeing the brown tom. “I wanted to 


show you where the new traps were.” 

Growler glanced at Tuna. “For some 
reason, you're the only cat who’s 
allowed to know.” 

“You can come too if you like.” 
Tigerheart forced his shoulders to 
loosen. He wanted to look relaxed. 
“You'd better hurry, though. It looks like 
rain.” 

Growler flicked his tail. “Let Tuna 
get wet. I’ve got scraps to finish.” 

As the black-and-white tom 
disappeared into the bushes, Tigerheart 
beckoned Tuna closer with a flick of his 
muzzle. “I have to talk to you,” he 
whispered. 

Tuna frowned but followed him to 


the closest slab. “Is something wrong?” 

“You want to go back to your old 
camp, right?” 

Tuna eyed Tigerheart warily. “If 
there are no foxes.” 

“Tve got a plan to get rid of them,” 
Tigerheart told him. “But I need you to 
show me where to go.” 

Tuna narrowed his eyes. “Why 
should I do that?” 

“Because, surely, you can’t be so 
mouse-brained as to not realize that this 
would be good for every cat?” 
Tigerheart stared at him pleadingly. “If 
you don’t help, the Twolegs and their 
traps are going to drive us all away from 
here.” 


“Okay.” Tuna hunched tighter against 
the cold wind. “Tell me your plan.” 


The next morning, before dawn, 
Tigerheart crept out of the guardian cats’ 
den. The night sky was swathed in cloud. 
He narrowed his eyes against the rain 
that was gently misting the city. Fierce, 
Cobweb, and Ant followed as he padded 
across the grass. Shivering in the cold, 
he fluffed out his fur. Orange Twoleg 
light reflected eerily off the wet stone. 
The towering dens slept in shadow 
except for occasional patches of light, 
which showed in their walls where 
Twolegs were beginning to stir for the 
day. Tigerheart quickened his step. The 
foxes would have spent the might 


scavenging and would be heading back 
to their den before Twolegs took over 
the city. The walkways and 
Thunderpaths were empty now. There 
would be no better time to lead the foxes 
to the traps. 

He smelled fear-scent on the 
guardian cats and wanted to reassure 
them. But he couldnt make any 
promises. They’d traced out two routes 
yesterday with the help of Tuna. With 
any luck, they could split the fox pack 
and lead them to the gathering place in 
two groups. The fewer foxes each patrol 
had to manage, the better. 

“Tigerheart!” A whispered mew 
sounded through the rain. A dark shape 


bounded toward them. It was Tuna. “I’m 
coming with you.” 

Tigerheart felt a surge of gratitude. 
Not all city cats were rogues after all. 
“You don’t have to risk your pelt.” 

“I want to help.” Tuna stopped in 
front of him, his eyes shimmering in the 
strange Twoleg light. 

Ant shrugged. “It can’t do any harm.” 

Tigerheart saw doubt in Fierce’s 
gaze. 

“Can we trust him? What if he tries 
to confuse the foxes?” she demanded. 

“Why would he do that?” Tigerheart 
countered. “We’re going to get his old 
home back.” 

“And he knows the routes even 


better than we do,” Cobweb pointed out. 

Fierce stared at Tuna for a moment, 
then nodded. “Okay.” 

Tigerheart hesitated, unsure which 
cat should take the lead. It was his plan, 
and Fierce claimed that the guardian cats 
had no leader, but he knew the others 
respected her authority and he didn’t 
want to challenge it. Suddenly he felt 
like a deputy again. With a pang he 
thought of Rowanstar. Had his father 
finally found his paws and taken firm 
leadership of ShadowClan? 

“Come on.” Tuna surprised him by 
heading first into the yellow light 
pooling beneath a pole at the side of the 
Thunderpath. As the brown tom passed 


through the light and into the shadow 
beyond, the others followed, glancing 
nervously at one another. Tigerheart fell 
in behind. 

No cat pushed ahead of Tuna as he 
led the winding way through alleys and 
streets to the dilapidated part of the city 
where his camp had been. He picked his 
way along a crumbling wall, which 
edged an open space between two 
broken Twoleg dens. Twoleg clutter 
littered the site. 

“My nest was in there.” Tuna nodded 
to gap beneath a slab of wood. “‘There’s 
a fox nest inside now.” 

Tigerheart padded softly along the 
wall, weaving past Cobweb, Ant, and 


Fierce. He stopped beside Tuna and 
tasted the air. The fox scent was strong, 
but stale after the might’s rain. “They’re 
not back yet.” He scanned the dark 
camp. No Twoleg light flickered here, 
and he strained to see through the gloom. 

Overhead, the pale clouds were 
showing the first signs of dawn. “Let’s 
stay out of sight until they come.” 
Tigerheart hopped off the wall and 
crouched behind it. Silently, Cobweb, 
Ant, Fierce, and Tuna followed. “You 
remember the plan?” he whispered. 

They nodded. 

“Which group will Tuna be in?” Ant 
asked. 

“He’ll come with me and Cobweb.” 


He glanced at Cobweb. The gray tom 
dipped his head in agreement. He looked 
small, his long fur slicked against his 
body by the rain. 

They crouched in the shelter of the 
wall. Fear fluttered like a trapped bird 
in Tigerheart’s belly. The stone beneath 
his pads was slippery. What if one of the 
cats lost their footing while leading the 
foxes through the twisting route they’d 
picked out? “Keep your eye on your 
partner,” he warned Fierce, Ant, and 
Cobweb. “If you fall, call for help. 
Leave no cat behind to face the foxes 
alone.” He blinked at Tuna. “Agreed?” 

“Agreed.” Tuna’s tail twitched 
nervously. 


Ant and Cobweb eyed each other 
doubtfully. 

“What?” Tigerheart glared at them. 
This was no time to start questioning 
orders. 

“Arent you scared?” Cobweb 
ventured. 

“Of course I’m scared,” Tigerheart 
told him. “But this needs to be done.” 

“Maybe it would just be easier to 
find a new home after all,” Ant 
murmured. 

Tigerheart stiffened. “Not after—” 

Fierce cut him off. “We’re not 
leaving.” She looked sternly from 
Cobweb to Ant. “A cat can spend her 
whole life running, or she can make a 


stand and defend her home.” 

Warmth washed Tigerheart’s pelt. 
Fierce was sounding like a leader. 

Ant blinked in surprise. “You’re 
starting to sound like Tigerheart.” 

Fierce sniffed. “I like our den, that’s 
all. Do you really think we could find a 
better place to spend the rest of ice- 
chill?” 

“I guess not,” Ant conceded. 

Cobweb shifted his paws. “Is this 
what it’s like to be a warrior?” he asked 
Tigerheart. 

“Not all the time,” Tigerheart told 
him. “But we’re prepared to take risks to 
defend what’s ours, when we have to.” 

Tuna’s_ whiskers twitched wryly. 


“Pm guessing warriors aren’t used to 
change.” 

Tigerheart frowned. “What do you 
mean?” 

“Tn the city, it’s rare to have anything 
long enough to need to defend it.” He 
nodded toward his old camp. “This was 
swarming with Twolegs before I was 
born. Now it’s swarming with foxes. 
Fog was raised beside the trash field. 
Then she lived under a bridge. Growler 
moved here when his Twolegs 
abandoned him.” 

Tigerheart felt a twinge of pity for 
these strays, but they didn’t seem 
downhearted. They were watching him 
with interest, as though trying to make 


sense of him. 

“Don’t you get bored of fighting for 
the same territory?” Tuna asked. “Don’t 
you ever just want to move on and find a 
new way to live?” 

Fierce answered for him. “He’s 
here, isn’t he? He left one life to make a 
new life here.” 

“Then why does he act like he’s still 
a warrior?” Tuna asked. 

“Because I am!” Tigerheart bristled. 
Did these cats think he’d left the Clans 
because he was tired of Clan life? Did 
they think he wanted to be like them? To 
stay here forever? 

Fierce tipped her head 
sympathetically. “You'll need to learn to 


be more flexible if you want to survive 
in the cit—” 

The crunch of shifting rubble made 
her stop. Tigerheart pricked his ears. 

Tuna opened his mouth to taste the 
air. “They’re back.” 

Tigerheart listened to the brush of fur 
and scrabble of paws beyond the wall. 
“Do you remember your routes?” 

Cobweb, Ant, and Fierce nodded. 

“Tuna,” Tigerheart blinked at the 
brown tabby. “Stay with me.” 

“Okay.” 

Tigerheart leaped onto the wall. His 
pelt prickled with fear as he saw five 
shapes moving in the half-light. Three of 
the foxes were large and well-muscled. 


The two smaller foxes looked lithe. The 
stench of them made Tigerheart’s nose 
wrinkle. As Fierce, Cobweb, Ant, and 
Tuna jumped up beside him, he nodded 
toward the biggest fox. “Tuna and 
Cobweb will surround that one while 
Fierce and Ant try to corner the other.” 
He pointed his muzzle toward the second 
largest fox. “If we can separate them 
now, hopefully the others will split up 
when they follow. Fierce, lead yours 
back the way we came. Cobweb, we’ll 
lead ours through the big stone clearing.” 

The cats nodded. 

“Let’s go.” Tigerheart jumped softly 
onto broken stone and picked his way 
down the pile. Tuna and Cobweb 


followed, while Fierce and Ant 
approached the sleek dog fox Tigerheart 
had directed them toward. 

Tigerheart kept low as they moved 
through shadow to where the biggest fox 
was snuffling beside a heap of Twoleg 
clutter. The smaller foxes were snarling 
softy at each other, arguing over scraps 
they’d dropped at the edge of the camp. 
Tigerheart signaled to Cobweb and Tuna 
with a flick of his tail, ordering them to 
circle around the far side of their target. 
He paused and waited for them to get 
into position. As they surrounded the 
fox, Fierce’s yowl wailed eerily through 
the dawn air. Tigerheart saw the foxes 
freeze. Their beady eyes flashed toward 


Fierce. The orange flecks in her 
tortoiseshell pelt glowed in the dawn 
light. A moment before they lunged for 
her, Tigerheart lifted his head and 
screeched. The large dog fox, which 
he’d been stalking, jerked its muzzle 
toward him. Tigerheart leaped for it, 
raked his claws across its muzzle, and 
ran. 

Blood roared in his ears as fear 
shrilled through every hair on his pelt. 
He streaked from the camp onto the 
deserted Thunderpath. Leaping scattered 
rubble, he glanced over his shoulder. 
Rain sprayed his face. Cobweb and Tuna 
were behind him. The dog fox followed, 
two vixens at its tail. Triumph surged in 


Tigerheart’s chest. They’d split the pack 
as they'd planned. All they had to do 
now was keep ahead of it. “Take the 
lead!” he called to Tuna. The stray had 
traveled these streets more often than 
Tigerheart, and Tigerheart wanted to stay 
between the foxes and the city cats. His 
fighting skills were better. If they hit 
trouble, he wanted to face the foxes first. 

A deserted white dwelling loomed 
ahead. An alley opened beside it. This 
would be the first of their turns. Tuna 
had picked the alley especially because 
it led to a maze of passageways that cut 
one way, then the other. The cats could 
negotiate the turns more nimbly than the 
foxes, which would let them put some 


distance between themselves and their 
pursuers. They had to pull ahead as far 
as they could here, because once they hit 
the stone clearing, the foxes would have 
the advantage of speed. Alarm gripped 
Tigerheart’s belly. What if the foxes 
gave up chasing? 

Tuna was almost at the head of the 
alley. Cobweb was at his heels. As 
Tigerheart reached the entrance, he 
stopped, twisted, and reared. The fox 
behind him bristled in surprise. Behind 
it, the two other foxes blinked in 
confusion as the lead fox slowed and 
showed its teeth. 

“What are you doing?” Tuna’s 
panicked screech faded behind 


Tigerheart as the brown tom hared 
onward. 

Making sure these sly-hearted 
scroungers never want to stop chasing 
us. Tigerheart threw himself, hissing, at 
the head of the lead fox. Lashing out with 
one paw, then another, he felt fur rip 
under his claws. He smelled the warm 
scent of blood and heard the fox screech. 
Jaws snapped beside his cheek. He saw 
white teeth flash. In an instant, he turned 
and ran again. Cobweb and Tuna had 
stopped, their pelts bushed, their backs 
arched. “Run!” Tigerheart shrieked, 
nudging them ahead of him. 

Hot fox breath blasted his tail. He 
hared along the alley, picking up speed 


until he was pelting over the stone so 
fast, his pads burned. 

Tuna signaled the upcoming turn with 
a flick of his tail so that Tigerheart 
would remember which way to run. 
Skidding around a sharp corner, he 
followed Cobweb and Tuna into a 
narrow passageway. It curved one way, 
then another, the dens towering high on 
each side. Shadow hid the end, but Tuna 
signaled again before they reached it, 
and Tigerheart was ready for the next 
turn. As he skidded around it, the 
thumping of fox paws receded behind 
them. 

Tigerheart glanced back as the foxes 
scrambled around the corner in pursuit. 


They crashed clumsily into one another, 
bouncing off the wall of the passageway 
as they fought to keep their footing. Rage 
glittered in their eyes. The plan was 
working. With each turn, the patrol 
pulled farther ahead of the foxes, but 
each time he glanced back, Tigerheart 
could see determination in the eyes of 
their pursuers; the foxes weren’t about to 
give up. 

The stone clearing was near. It 
would be deserted now and easy to 
cross. But the foxes would cover the 
ground faster. Tigerheart’s lungs were 
burning. He could hear Tuna panting. 
Cobweb’s breath was fast and rough. 
Fear flickered through his thoughts. What 


if Cobweb and Tuna lacked the stamina 
to keep up this pace as they crossed the 
wide stretch of open stone? 

“Not far now!” Tigerheart yowled. 
He streaked past them as the passageway 
opened into the clearing, pushing harder 
against the ground, hardly seeing where 
he ran. But he knew where he was 
heading. The gap between the dens on 
the far side would lead though another 
short maze before it opened onto the 
green stretch of grass around the 
gathering place. Rascal, Mittens, and 
Pipsqueak would be waiting to take it 
from there. They would lead the foxes 
toward the traps, zigzagging around the 
slabs until each fox had stumbled into 


one of the mesh caves. 

The clearing echoed with the screech 
of one of the foxes. Tigerheart glanced 
over his shoulder. The lead fox was 
yelping. Its eyes shone with excitement 
as it spotted the open ground. Cobweb 
was lagging. The foxes were closing the 
gap. Hurry up! Tigerheart pushed 
harder, willing Cobweb on. He felt 
Tuna’s breath on his tail. “Is Cobweb 
going to make it?” the stray panted. 

Tigerheart saved his breath for the 
final push. The opening between the 
dens was close now. The next turn was 
only a few paces beyond it. They would 
have a chance to put some distance 
between themselves and the foxes once 


more. He dived into the alley and made 
the turn. A shriek sounded behind him. 
Had a fox caught Cobweb? He slowed, 
panic searing beneath his pelt. Turning, 
he saw Tuna streak past him. 

Cobweb swerved around the corner 
a moment later, surprise lighting his gaze 
as he saw Tigerheart lagging behind. 
“Keep running!” Cobweb wailed as he 
shot past Tigerheart. 

Tigerheart smelled the hot stench of 
fox breath. He turned and ran as paws 
pounded around the corner. Ahead, Tuna 
and Cobweb had reached the opening 
where a passageway cut across the alley. 
They ducked down the passage out of 
sight. Tigerheart chased after them. He 


heard the panting of the foxes behind him 
and unsheathed his claws. Hooking them 
against the rough stone, he propelled 
himself forward, running faster than he 
had in his whole life. He struggled for 
breath, his chest screaming for air as he 
reached the corner and veered along the 
passageway. Cobweb and Tuna raced 
ahead of him. Fox paws slithered behind 
on the wet stone. 

He smelled the familiar scents of the 
gathering place ahead and hared after 
Cobweb and Tuna. One turn, then 
another. The final alley. He burst from 
between the dens and raced across the 
Thunderpath, onto the grass. Then a paw 
hooked him from behind a stone slab and 


he fell sprawling on the ground. He 
smelled Dovewing’s scent and saw gray 
fur as strong paws dragged him behind 
the shelter of the stone. “Hush!” 
Dovewing whispered in his ear. 
“Rascal, Mittens, and Pipsqueak will 
handle this.” 

He glimpsed Cobweb and Tuna. 
They were safe behind the next slab, 
crouching in the grass as they struggled 
for breath. As the sound of fox paws 
rang on the Thunderpath, Mittens, 
Rascal, and Pipsqueak leaped from 
behind a slab a few rows away and 
yowled at the foxes. Red fur streaked 
past Tigerheart, not even slowing. With a 
snarl of frustration, the foxes raced 


toward Mittens. The tabby zigzagged 
around the stones in one direction, 
drawing the lead fox away. Mittens 
doubled back around a slab, raked his 
claws across the vixen’s snout, and led 
her another way. Pipsqueak stopped in 
front of the third fox and, as it stumbled 
in surprise, veered toward the far side of 
the gathering place. 

As the fox raced after him, 
Tigerheart saw Fierce and Ant explode 
from a passageway beyond the gathering 
place. Two foxes followed them onto the 
swath of grass as Dotty, Cinnamon, and 
Peanut ducked out from behind stone 
slabs. Deftly, they separated the pair. 
Peanut and Cinnamon led the larger fox 


one way; Dotty led the smaller fox 
another. 

Tigerheart felt the world blur around 
him. 

“Breathe,” Dovewing murmured into 
his ear. Like a half-drowned cat coming 
up for air, Tigerheart drew in a long, 
shuddering breath. Yowls and screeches 
filled the air around the gathering place. 
“Have they reached the traps?” he 
panted to Dovewing. 

Dovewing was straining to see 
through the drizzle. “I don’t know yet.” 

Paw steps sounded on the grass 
nearby. Fog appeared around the side of 
the stone slab. “What going on?” She 
looked from Tigerheart to Cobweb, her 


eyes widening as she saw Tuna. “Where 
have you been?” 

Tuna sat up. “Catching foxes,” he 
panted. 

As Fog stared at him wordlessly, 
Fierce crossed the grass to join them. 
Ant padded at her side, his paws 
trembling. 

“I hope Pipsqueak and the others get 
them into the traps,” she puffed. “I don’t 
ever want to do that again.” She flicked 
her tail around to show Tigerheart. A tuft 
of fur was missing from the end. “One of 
the foxes got closer than I'd planned.” 

Tigerheart blinked at her proudly. 
“But you made it.” 

As he spoke, Pipsqueak bounded 


across the grass to meet them. “We got 
them!” he meowed triumphantly. “Every 
one of them. Blaze, Boots, Bracken, and 
Spire were waiting beside the traps. The 
foxes were so confused to see more cats, 
they practically fell inside!” 

“What about the fifth fox?” 
Tigerheart asked anxiously. 

“Mittens and Rascal rounded it up 
and chased it into the big trap over 
there.” He pointed across the grass with 
his muzzle. Red fur flashed inside the 
mesh cage. Angry screeches rose around 
the gathering place as the foxes howled 
in frustration. 

Dovewing purred. “If they keep up 
that noise, it won’t be long before the 


Twolegs come to take them away.” 

Tigerheart looked at Fog. The stray’s 
eyes were wide with amazement. “You 
led the foxes here?” she breathed. “Into 
the traps?” 

Tuna purred breathlessly. “It was 
Tigerheart’s plan.” 

Fog blinked at Tigerheart. “You’re 
even crazier than I thought.” 

Tigerheart’s fur tingled with joy. 
“Now you have to keep your side of the 
agreement,” he meowed firmly. “You 
and your cats have to leave.” 

Fog stared at him for a moment, then 
dipped her head. “Okay.” 

“We can move back home,” Tuna 
meowed happily. 


“It'll smell of fox stench,’ Fog 
grunted. 

“Not for long,” Tuna promised. “It’s 
hardly changed apart from the smell. In 
fact I think the foxes have dug a few new 
nests in the rubble.” 

“You have to go now,” Tigerheart 
told Fog. “Before the Twolegs come to 
get their traps.” He wanted the Twolegs 
to find the land around gathering place 
deserted. They’d probably believe the 
foxes had chased the cats away before 
being trapped. 

Fierce stared at the Fog, her gaze 
hard. “Don’t come back,” she growled. 
“From now on, this is guardian-cat 
territory, and we’re ready to defend our 


borders.” 

Fog blinked at her, surprise showing 
in her blue gaze. “Okay.” She dipped her 
head. She clearly didn’t want to argue 
with cats who could trap foxes. 

Dovewing nuzzled Tigerheart’s ear. 
“Come on,” she murmured. “Let’s go and 
tell the kits.” 

As he followed Dovewing across the 
grass, Fierce’s words rang in his mind: 
From now on, this is guardian-cat 
territory, and we’re ready to defend our 
borders. At last she was beginning to 
think like a warrior. Tigerheart’s chest 
swelled with pride. He suddenly felt 
hopeful that the guardian cats could 
survive anything. Maybe this wasn’t 


such a bad place to raise kits after all. 





CHAPTER 26 
Cog 


“The kits!” 

Dovewing’s alarmed cry jerked 
Tigerheart from his doze. He opened his 
eyes and saw her, pelt still ruffled from 
sleep, scanning the gathering-place den 
frantically. “Pouncekit! Shadowkit! 
Lightkit! Where are you?” 

“They’re too small to reach the 
entrance by themselves.” Tigerheart 
lifted his head, irritated at being woken 
unnecessarily. “They’re probably just 
playing hide-and-seek again.” 

Tigerheart and Dovewing had drifted 
to sleep in a pool of afternoon sunshine, 


their bellies full after a meal of Twoleg 
scraps. Now the sky outside had turned 
pink as afternoon slid into twilight. 

Dovewing stared at him, round-eyed. 
“No, they can reach the ledge now! I 
caught them sniffing the entrance 
yesterday.” 

Tigerheart scrambled to his paw. 
Had they grown so much? Only a few 
days had passed since the Twolegs had 
carried away the traps. With the foxes 
gone and Fog and her friends back at 
their old camp, life had returned to its 
easy routine. 

“Blaze!” Dovewing crossed the den 
to where the ginger-and-white kit was 
nipping herbs from a twig. “Have you 


seen the kits?” 

Blaze looked up. “Sorry,” he 
mewed, spitting out leaf flecks. “I’ve 
been busy. I didn’t notice.” 

“Fierce? Mittens?” They were 
lounging at the far end of the den. “Have 
you seen my kits?” 

Fierce jumped to her paws. “Are 
they missing?” 

“I can’t see them anywhere.” 

Mittens glanced at the entrance. 
“Have you looked outside?” 

Tigerheart saw Dovewing’s pelt 
bush. He hurried to her side. “Let’s go 
and look.” 

“Do you want help?” Cinnamon 
ducked out from her nest beneath a pile 


of Twoleg clutter. 

“PII come too.” Pipsqueak left a 
half-chewed bone and padded to join 
them. 

“What if they’ve wandered onto a 
Thunderpath?” Dovewing fretted. 

“They're too smart.” Pipsqueak 
jumped up to the entrance. 

Cinnamon hopped after the brown- 
and-white tom. “I can smell their scent 
here,” she mewed. “I’m surprised no cat 
saw them leave.” 

Pipsqueak nosed through the gap. 
“They probably waited until no cat was 
looking.” 

“No, I saw them go.” Feather, the 
sick white she-cat, looked over the side 


3 


of her nest. “But I didn’t know they 
weren't allowed out.” 

Tigerheart paused. He’d never told 
the kits not to go outside. He’d assumed 
they were too small to reach the 
entrance. He looked at Dovewing. “Did 
you tell them not to go out without us?” 

Dovewing blinked at him. “Did 
you?” 

Tigerheart’s pelt prickled guiltily. “I 
should have.” He was angry with 
himself for not thinking of it, and angry 
at being stuck in the city. He shouldn’t 
need to explain such simple rules to kits. 
In the Clan, no kit was allowed out of 
camp. Every cat knew the rule. Few kits 
dared to break it. They knew their 


apprenticeship might be held back for a 
moon as punishment. 

“We have to find them.” Dovewing 
brushed past him and jumped up to the 
entrance. He scrambled after her. 

They won't have strayed beyond the 
hedge, surely? Tigerheart reassured 
himself as he slid outside. A heavy dew 
had already settled on the grass. The 
clear sky promised a chilly night. The 
dew would soon turn to frost. Dovewing 
was already nosing around the stone 
Slabs. Pipsqueak and Cinnamon were 
ranging farther, sniffing the stone 
boundary that edged the stretch of grass 
on this side of the gathering place. 

Tigerheart pricked his ears as he 


heard Twolegs murmuring. He jerked his 
nose around. A small group was 
clustered around one of the slabs at the 
end of the gathering place. They meowed 
quietly to each other. Tigerheart scanned 
the grass. Had the kits been mouse- 
brained enough to stray near them? 

“I see them!” Dovewing’s relieved 
mew rang through the air. Tigerheart 
followed her gaze and saw Pouncekit, 
Lightkit, and Shadowkit sitting like 
starlings in the branch of a tree at the 
edge of the grass. Dovewing bounded 
toward them. 

Tigerheart chased after her. 
“Thanks,” he called to Cinnamon and 
Pipsqueak who had turned to look. ““We 


can get them down.” 

Cinnamon turned anxiously toward 
the cluster of Twolegs. “Do you want us 
to distract them?” 

“No.” Tigerheart slowed. “It’s 
probably best if you and Pipsqueak go 
back inside. If the Twolegs see too many 
cats, they might bring their traps back.” 

Cinnamon dipped her head and 
beckoned to Pipsqueak with a flick of 
her tail. Skirting the Twolegs, they 
headed back toward the den entrance. 

“What are you doing up there?” 
Dovewing called. 

Pouncekit looked down, breaking 
into a purr as Tigerheart reached 
Dovewing. “Look at us!” she squeaked. 


“We climbed up all by ourselves.” 

Tigerheart frowned at the excited kit. 
“Have you planned how you’re going to 
get down?” 

Pouncekit’s face fell as she looked 
toward the ground. She nudged Lightkit. 
“Look!” Her sister wobbled on the 
branch. She was straining to see the 
Twolegs. Pouncekit nudged her again. 
“Dovewing and Tigerheart are here.” 

Lightkit looked down, her eyes 
lighting up as she saw them. “We’re 
watching the Twolegs.” 

Shadowkit peered over the edge. 
Guilt flashed in his eyes as he met 
Tigerheart’s stern gaze. “We weren't 
going to be long. But Pouncekit said that 


the Twolegs were being weird.” 

“They've dug a hole in the ground 
and they’ve put something in it,” 
Pouncekit mewed excitedly. “What do 
you think they’re hiding? It looks big. 
Perhaps it’s something special they want 
to keep safe during ice-chill.” 

“Leaf-bare,’’ Tigerheart corrected 
tetchily. She sounded like a stray. 

Lightkit’s fur was spiked with 
excitement. “They’ve gathered flowers 
and put them all around the hole. It looks 
pretty.” 

As she spoke, Shadowkit’s eyes 
widened in alarm. A Twoleg kit had 
broken away from the cluster and was 
running toward them. 


“Quick!” Tigerheart ordered. “Come 
down from there. We have to go inside.” 

“But we’re safe here.” Pouncekit 
watched the Twoleg kit running closer. 
“Why don’t you jump up?” 

Tigerheart turned toward the Twoleg 
kit and arched his back. He hissed 
loudly, flattening his ears. 

The kit stopped, alarm sparking in its 
tiny eyes. 

A big Twoleg hurried after it, 
holding out a paw and mewling. It pulled 
the kit away. 

Tigerheart jerked his gaze back 
toward Pouncekit. “We have to get back 
inside right now,” he meowed sternly. 
“Do you want the Twolegs to start 


leaving traps for us again?” 

Pouncekit frowned crossly. “It’s not 
fair. All we ever see is the inside of the 
den, and we’ve explored all the Twoleg 
clutter in there. We want to see 
something new.” 

Dovewing reached up the tree with 
her forepaws, her gaze sparking with 
worry as Pouncekit padded toward the 
trunk and began to slither down, tail 
first. 

“Dig your claws in!” Dovewing 
gasped as Pouncekit slipped suddenly 
and her hindquarters thumped against the 
bark. 

“Tm digging!” Pouncekit puffed as 
she clung to the trunk like a squirrel and 


eased herself down, a muzzle-length at a 
time. 

Dovewing grabbed her scruff as 
soon as it was within reach and plopped 
her on the ground. “Stay there,” she 
meowed firmly, and looked up toward 
Lightkit. “Your turn.” 

While Dovewing watched Lightkit, 
Tigerheart frowned crossly at Pouncekit. 
“You're not meant to leave the den 
without us.” 

Pouncekit stared back at him, her 
dark amber eyes wide. “But why? The 
traps are gone.” 

“What if the Twolegs put them 
back?” Tigerheart challenged. 

Pouncekit narrowed her eyes 


petulantly. “It’s not fair,” she mewed. 
“You're only yelling at me because I 
was the first one to come down. But 
being the first to come down was good, 
wasn’t it?” She looked up at Shadowkit, 
who was waiting while Lightkit slid 
clumsily down the trunk. “He’s still 
there, and you’re not yowling at him.” 

“Pm not yowling at any of you.” 
Tigerheart swallowed back frustration. 
“Pm just telling you that you’re not 
allowed outside without Dovewing or 
me.” 

“Ever? ” Pouncekit frowned. Lightkit 
squeaked as Dovewing grabbed her 
scruff and dropped her on the grass. 
Pouncekit turned her head and stared 


indignantly at her sister. ““Tigerheart says 
we’re never allowed to leave the den 
ever.” 

“Ever?” Horror sparked in Lightkit’s 
gaze. “That’s not fair! The other cats go 
out all the time.” 

“I didn’t say ever.” Tigerheart’s pelt 
prickled irritably. He wondered if the 
kits would be so argumentative if they’d 
been raised in a Clan. He felt sure that 
he’d never argued with Rowanstar like 
this when he was a kit. 

Dovewing was staring into the tree, 
where Shadowkit was teetering 
nervously in the crook of a branch. 
“You're going to have to go up and get 
him,” she meowed. 


Pouncekit looked at her brother 
disdainfully. “Poor Shadowkit. He’s 
such a scaredy-mouse.” 

Tigerheart padded to the foot of the 
tree. Hooking his claws into the bark, he 
hauled himself up until he was level 
with Shadowkit. Then he grabbed the 
kits scruff and let himself slide 
carefully down, balancing Shadowkit on 
his chest. 

As he reached the ground, Shadowkit 
leaped onto the grass. “I didn’t need 
help.” He shook out his pelt. “I was just 
planning my route so I didn’t look as 
clumsy as Pouncekit and Lightkit.”” He 
glared at his sisters. 

Dovewing whisked her tail. “Come 


on,” she ordered. “Let’s go inside.” 

“Can’t we explore some more first?” 
Lightkit pleaded. 

Dovewing pointed her muzzle 
toward the cluster of black-pelted 
Twolegs. “Not while they’re here.” 

Lightkit huffed and began to march 
toward the den. Pouncekit followed, and 
Shadowkit hurried at their heels. 

Dovewing caught Tigerheart’s eye. 
“At least they're adventurous.” Her 
whiskers twitched suddenly with 
amusement. 

Relieved they were safe, Tigerheart 
touched his muzzle to hers. “They’re 
going to be fine warriors one day.” 

“Yes.” Dovewing purred and 


followed the kits. 

Tigerheart glanced across the grass, 
wondering how long he would have to 
wait before they could take the kits back 
to the Clans. The den was clearly no 
longer enough to keep them occupied. 
But outside, the city was full of danger. 
They should be in the forest, learning the 
difference between a mouse and a 
shrew, and which birds woke them in the 
morning and sang them to sleep at night. 

As his mind wandered, he noticed 
Spire. The healer was sitting a few slabs 
away, gazing at the Twolegs. As 
Dovewing guided the kits through the 
gap beside the clear stretch of wall, 
Tigerheart headed toward the skinny 


tom. Ducking behind slabs, he reached 
Spire without being spotted by the 
Twolegs. 

“What are you doing here?” he 
whispered. 

Spire looked at him blankly. Hes 
having a vision. The healer’s gaze 
barely focused on Tigerheart before 
drifting lazily back to the Twolegs. 

Tigerheart shifted his paws. Should 
he leave Spire in peace? But what if that 
Twoleg kit started to nose around again? 
The tom probably wouldn’t notice until 
too late. PUH stay and guard him. 

Spire closed his eyes. He swayed, 
murmuring to himself. “Kits or no kits.” 

Tigerheart’s belly tightened. 


“Spire?” What was the strange cat 
dreaming about? 

Spire opened his eyes and stared at 
Tigerheart, as though expecting to see 
him. “You came.” 

Tigerheart twitched his tail 
nervously. “What did you dream?” 

“Dream?” Spire tipped his head. He 
looked confused. “I heard a voice. A 
voice . . . from the stars . . . meant for 
you.” 

“Stars? For me... ?” Tigerheart’s 
pelt prickled. Spire had never mentioned 
stars before. Did this mean StarClan was 
trying to reach him through this strange 
cat? Should Tigerheart have gone back 
to ShadowClan after Spire’s first 


dream? 

But how could I have done that? 
The kits . . . Anxiety began to churn in 
his belly. Suddenly all the worries that 
had suffocated him while he was in the 
forest seemed to swirl around him once 
more. “What did it say?” 

Spire’s yellow gaze seemed to clear 
as he stared at Tigerheart. His eyes 
flashed as though he’d remembered 
something long forgotten. “I had to tell 
you that he needs you.” 

“Who needs me?” Tigerheart leaned 
closer, his breath catching in his throat. 

Spire didn’t seem to hear him. “The 
shadows are fading. He can’t keep them 
together.” 


Alarm flared beneath Tigerheart’s 
pelt. Rowanstar! His father needed him. 
He knew it as certainly as he’d known 
he should be with Dovewing. There was 
no doubt now that StarClan was trying to 
reach him here in the city... . 

They want me to go back! 





CHAPTER 27 
Cog 


Tigerheart hardly slept. He stared into 
the darkness while Dovewing and the 
kits snored gently beside him, anxiety 
swirling through his thoughts. How 
would he tell Dovewing? There was no 
time to wait. The kits were so young. But 
he had to go back now. 

As dawn lifted the darkness, he 
gazed at Dovewing, still sleeping beside 
him. The kits were too big now to curl at 
her belly, and they snuggled around her 
instead. Pouncekit’s tail trailed over her 
cheek. Lightkit’s forepaws rested on her 
flank, while Shadowkit stretched along 


her spine. Were they old enough to make 
the journey? Would Dovewing agree? 
Tigerheart’s throat tightened. Would he 
have to leave without them? 

He crept from the nest and scanned 
the den. The guardian cats were stirring 
as gray dawn light filtered through the 
walls. 

Fierce climbed from her nest and 
stretched. “Who wants to come 
scavenging with me?” 

“T will.” Ant slid from beneath a pile 
of Twoleg clutter. 

Cinnamon crossed the floor. “So 
will I.” 

Mittens stretched beneath the den 
entrance. “PIH come.” 


Tigerheart hurried forward. Fresh air 
would help him think. He had to find the 
words to tell Dovewing that he needed 
to leave. “PI join you.” 

Fierce was already leaping onto the 
wooden ledge that led to the entrance. 
Cinnamon, Ant, and Mittens followed 
her out of the den. 

“Wait.” Dovewing’s soft mew 
sounded behind Tigerheart. 

He glanced over his shoulder. She 
was stepping softly from the nest. The 
kits had rolled into the space she’d left, 
still asleep. 

“Pm coming with you.” Dovewing’s 
green gaze was soft in the dawn light. 
She hurried past him, stopping at Blaze’s 


nest. As he lifted his head sleepily, she 
blinked at him. “Can you keep an eye on 
the kits? We’re going scavenging with 
Fierce.” 

“Okay.” He yawned, climbed from 
his nest, and headed toward the kits. 

“Thanks, Blaze.” Dovewing turned 
to Tigerheart and flicked her tail. “Do 
you mind if I come?” 

“Of course not.” His heart sank. 
There would be no time to think of the 
right words to tell her. He couldn’t keep 
this to himself: He’d have to tell her 
now. What would she say? Sadness 
swamped him. If she thought the kits 
were too young to travel, he would be 
abandoning her a second time. 


Dovewing followed him from the 
den. Outside, the streets were quiet. 
Monsters were beginning to prowl, and 
here and there a Twoleg scuttled along 
the walkways, head bent against the cold 
wind. She shifted beside him as he 
waited for a Twoleg light to turn green. 
“What are we waiting for?” She looked 
along the deserted Thunderpath, then 
bounded across the stone. “I haven’t 
been out this early since before the kits 
were born,” she mewed as he followed 
her to the other side. “I forgot how quiet 
the city could be.” 

Fierce’s scent drifted on the breeze 
here. Tigerheart guessed that the 
tortoiseshell was heading for her 


favorite scrapcans. He headed in the 
opposite direction. If he was going to 
talk to Dovewing, he didn’t want to 
bump into the guardian cats. 

“Fierce and the others went that 
way.” Dovewing gestured away from 
herself, glancing at him curiously. 

“I need to talk to you.” Tigerheart 
kept his gaze straight ahead. His heart 
quickened as he spoke. There was no 
avoiding the conversation now. 

“Okay.” Dovewing didn’t look at 
him, but moved closer, guiding him 
toward the wall as a Twoleg turned the 
corner and began hurrying toward them. 

Tigerheart didn’t speak until the 
Twoleg had passed. Ahead, a narrow 


gap opened between the dens. Tigerheart 
knew that it led to a small opening 
where Twolegs left scrapcans. They 
rarely contained food, but it would be a 
sheltered spot to talk. He turned in to the 
gap as they reached it and led the way to 
the small clearing. 

Dovewing followed  wordlessly. 
“So?” She searched his gaze anxiously 
as he stopped beside the scrapcans and 
faced her. “What did you want to tell 
me?” 

Tigerheart gazed into the green 
depths of her eyes. Please understand 
that I love you. “Spire had another 
vision.” 

Dovewing’s gaze didn’t flicker. She 


stared at him, stiller than stone. 

“He heard a voice,” Tigerheart went 
on. “A voice Spire said was for me. It 
gave him a message about Rowanstar.” 

Still, Dovewing did not speak. 
Anxiety glittered in her eyes. 

“The voice said he needs me. It said 
he can’t keep the shadows together.” 
Tigerheart saw Dovewing’s flanks move 
as her breath quickened. She held his 
gaze mutely. Say something. He had to 
know what she was thinking. When she 
didn’t speak, he stumbled on, trying to 
explain. “I can’t ignore this sign,” he 
meowed desperately. “Rowanstar can’t 
keep the Clan together. I have to go back. 
Please don’t think I don’t love you. You 


and the kits are the most important things 
in my life. But if I abandon my Clan 
now, when they need me, I will never 
forgive myself.” Grief pressed in his 
chest. Will I ever be able to forgive 
myself for abandoning Dovewing and 
our kits? 

Dovewing’s eyes shimmered with 
pain. She stared at him, the wind ruffling 
her pale gray fur. “I once told you that I 
would love you whatever choice you 
made,” she mewed thickly. Tigerheart 
could hardly breathe as she went on. “I 
won’t make you choose between your 
Clan and me this time.” 

Was she telling him to go? 
Tigerheart’s thoughts seemed to freeze. 


He could only stare into Dovewing’s 
eyes, trying to read what she was 
feeling. Was she angry? Was his leaving 
all she and the kits would remember of 
him? “I’m sorry,” he murmured, his heart 
splitting with pain. “Please forgive me.” 

Dovewing blinked. “Forgive you for 
what? We’ ll leave together.” 

Really? As he stared at her dumbly, 
hardly able to believe his ears, dawn 
sunshine found a crack between the nests 
and cut a strip across the clearing. 

“You saw the kits yesterday,” 
Dovewing went on. “They climbed a 
tree by themselves. No one taught them 
how to climb. They wanted to see more 
of the world than we have shown them. 


They are eager for adventure.” She 
paused, fear darkening her gaze. “I think 
they are ready to make the journey 
home.” 

Tigerheart could hardly believe his 
ears. “Do you mean it?” 

“Yes.” Dovewing whisked her tail. 
“Its a dangerous journey. I’m not letting 
you make it alone.” 

“But the kits.” If it was dangerous 
for him, then for young kits it could be 
deadly. ““They’re not old enough to—” 

Dovewing cut him off. “As long as 
they are with us, they will be safe.” She 
glanced the way they’d come. Monsters 
moved beyond the gap. “Come sunup, 
the city will be crowded with Twolegs 


and monsters. Foxes roam the streets at 
night. Cats with no more honor than 
rogues scavenge in every alley. This is 
no place for kits to live. Besides .. .” 
She looked away, her pelt prickling. 
“Spire isn’t the only cat who’s had 
dreams.” 

Tigerheart leaned forward anxiously. 
“Did you have another dream? Like the 
one that led us here?” 

She shook her head. “Shadowkit told 
me he dreamed about a silver-and-white 
tabby.” 

Tigerheart stiffened. Had Spire been 
right about the kit? Had Shadowkit seen 
this tabby “in the shadows”? 

Sadness misted Dovewing’s gaze. “It 


sounded like Ivypool. And the cat in the 
dream had kits. What if Ivypool’s really 
had kits? I want to meet them. I want 
them to meet Pouncekit, Lightkit, and 
Shadowkit. I don’t want them to be 
strangers. They need to be with the 
Clans. We have to get them home before 
they're old enough to become ’paws. 
They have so much to learn about Clan 
life.” 

Become ‘paws. ‘Tigerheart could 
imagine Pouncekit clinging to the trunk 
of a pine, arguing with her mentor about 
how far up she should climb. He purred 
suddenly. “I feel sorry for the warrior 
who has Pouncekit as an apprentice.” 

Dovewing’s whiskers twitched with 


amusement. “She'll question every 
order.” 

“She’ll probably try to give her 
mentor hunting tips.” Tigerheart’s heart 
warmed as though sunshine poured 
through it. 

“The guardian cats have been good 
to us,” Dovewing meowed. “But I don’t 
want our kits to think that healing the 
sick and avoiding Twolegs is all there is 
to life.” 

Tigerheart purred louder. “Our kits 
aren’t even very good at avoiding 
Twolegs. Did you see them in that tree?” 

Dovewing purred too. “The only 
way they could have attracted more 
attention would have been to yowl at 


them.” 

“Pm glad we found them in time.” 
Tigerheart stopped purring as he 
pictured the Twoleg kit running toward 
the tree. What would have happened if 
he hadn’t been there to scare it away? 
The kits had been trapped and hadn’t 
even realized it. 

Dovewing’s gaze darkened. “We did 
find them, though. But they need to be 
back in the forest. For the first time, I 
realized how little they understand about 
what it means to be a warrior. No Clan 
cat would have let curiosity cloud their 
judgment. The kits should have known 
the risk they were taking.” 

They need to be back in the forest. 


Tigerheart’s belly twisted with worry at 
Dovewing’s words. “Which forest?” he 
asked bluntly. 

Dovewing hesitated. 

“You said that Pouncekit, Lightkit, 
and Shadowkit mustn’t be strangers to 
Ivypool’s kits,” he pressed. “Do you 
plan to raise them in ThunderClan?” 

Dovewing shifted her paws self- 
consciously. 

“You know I have to go back to 
ShadowClan,” he breathed. 

“I know.” She dropped her gaze. 
“My heart tells me to be with you. My 
head tells me to raise my kits among my 
kin.” 

“Theyre my kits too,’ Tigerheart 


pointed out. 

Alarm sparked in her eyes. “Would 
you try to take them from me if I don’t 
join ShadowClan?” 

The pain in her mew sliced his heart. 
Now he was making her choose, and 
trying to use their kits to pressure her. 
“Pm sorry,’ he blurted guiltily. “Of 
course I wouldn’t. If you want to be with 
ThunderClan, the kits must stay with you 
until they are old enough to make their 
own decision.” 

Her fur smoothed. She lifted her 
chin. “We don’t need to think about that 
yet,” she mewed decisively. “It’s a long 
way to the lake, and we don’t know what 
we'll find when we get there. Let’s get 


home first, then worry about what to do 
next.” 

Tigerheart padded forward, guessing 
that, despite her words, Dovewing must 
be feeling as anxious as he was. Could 
they really make such a journey with 
kits? He tried not to think of all the 
dangers that lay between the city and the 
lake. Even the thought of Pouncekit 
beside the Silverpath made his belly 
clench. The wind from a Thundersnake 
was strong enough to sweep her beneath 
its paws. He closed his eyes, trying not 
to tremble as he pressed his cheek 
against Dovewing’s. “Everything will be 
okay,” he murmured softly, trying to 
reassure himself as much as Dovewing. 


Fierce blinked slowly at Tigerheart. 
He wondered for a moment if she’d 
heard him. “We have to leave,” he 
meowed again. “My Clan needs me.” 

Fierce got to her paws and dipped 
her head to Tigerheart. “We will miss 
you.” 

Dovewing sat behind him. He could 
hear Pouncekit, Lightkit, and Shadowkit 
fidgeting beside her. The kits had been 
fizzing with excitement since Tigerheart 
and Dovewing had told them that they 
were going back to the lake. 

“We’re going to be warriors!” 
Lightkit had squeaked. 

“Can we ride real badgers when we 
get to the forest?” Pouncekit had asked 


eagerly. 

Shadowkit’s gray pelt had rippled 
nervously. “Will we see a 
Thundersnake?” 

Tigerheart and Dovewing had 
answered as many questions as they 
could, but as the kits grew noisier, 
Tigerheart knew he’d have to break the 
news to Fierce before the guardian cats 
overheard them. Telling Pouncekit, 
Shadowkit, and Lightkit to sit quietly, 
he’d crossed the floor to share their 
news with Fierce. 

The tortoiseshell beckoned the other 
guardian cats closer now with a flick of 
her tail. Cobweb and Rascal left the 
scraps they were sharing. Mittens, Ant, 


and Cinnamon padded from the strip of 
sunshine they had been bathing in. Spire 
and Blaze left Feather and Scowl 
watching from their nests. Dotty, 
Pipsqueak, Peanut, and Bracken fanned 
out around Tigerheart and Dovewing, 
while Boots watched from beneath the 
wooden ledge near the entrance. 

Fierce lifted her chin. “Tigerheart 
and Dovewing have to leave us,” she 
announced. 

Dotty frowned. “Where are you 
going?” 

“Have you found a new den?” 
Mittens asked. 

“We’re going back to the lake,” 
Tigerheart told them. “My Clan needs 


99 


me. 

Cinnamon padded closer, her eyes 
sharp with interest. “How do you 
know?” 

“I think a StarClan cat spoke to me 
through Spire.” Tigerheart decided that it 
was easier to be honest, even if the cats 
didn’t believe him. “ShadowClan is in 
trouble.” 

Blaze glanced at Spire in surprise. 
“How did it talk through you? Did it 
come to visit?” 

Spire met the young tom’s gaze. “I 
heard a voice in a vision.” 

“And that’s why you’re leaving?” 
Mittens’s eyes widened. 

“That’s crazy!” Rascal spluttered. 


“Spire’s always having visions. We 
don’t act on them.” 

Cinnamon had narrowed her eyes. 
“You forget that where Tigerheart and 
Dovewing come from, cats take dreams 
seriously.” Her gaze drifted toward 
Dovewing. “Isn’t that what brought you 
here in the first place?” 

“Yes.” Dovewing wrapped her tail 
around Shadowkit, who huddled closer 
as the guardian cats stared. “And now a 
dream is taking us home. Our hearts tell 
us it’s the right thing to do.” 

Mittens sniffed. “It seems like a 
weird way to make decisions.” 

Spire blinked slowly at the tabby 
tom. “You listen to your belly when it’s 


hungry and your throat when it’s thirsty. 
Why not be guided by your heart when it 
speaks to you?” 

Fierce padded forward and touched 
her muzzle to Tigerheart’s cheek, then to 
Dovewing’s. “We are glad you came. 
You have taught us a lot, and we’ll miss 
you when you’re gone. But I guessed you 
wouldn’t stay forever.” She looked 
fondly at Pouncekit and Lightkit. “The 
call of home is strongest when you have 
kits.” She purred at Shadowkit. “I’m 
glad they will be raised among their own 
kind as warriors.” 

“I want to be a warrior!” Blaze’s 
mew took Tigerheart by surprise. The kit 
was beginning to lose his kit fluff, but he 


still wasn’t old enough to become a 
’ paw. 

“Yov’re too young,” he answered. 

“They're not!” Blaze pointed his 
nose as Pouncekit and Lightkit. 

“They ll have to train for many 
moons,” Tigerheart explained. 

“I could train too.” Blaze stared at 
him boldly. “Let me come. I can help you 
scavenge and take care of the kits.” 

Dovewing shifted her paws uneasily. 
“You're still a kit yourself.” 

Spire padded to Blaze’s side. “Let 
him join you,” he mewed softly. “It 
would make my decision easier.” 

Dovewing tipped her head. 
Tigerheart blinked at the skinny tom in 


surprise. “What decision?” he asked. 

“Tm traveling with you,” Spire told 
him. 

I will not live beside the widewater. 
Tigerheart remembered their 
conversation. Spire had wanted Blaze to 
go, but he hadn’t wanted to come with 
them. “Ill take Blaze. If he’s prepared to 
train hard, then he might make a great 
warrior one day. But you said you didn’t 
belong beside the lake.” 

“It is not important that I belong,” 
Spire mewed softly. “It is only important 
that I make the journey.” 

Cinnamon swished her tail. “I want 
to come too.” 

“So do I.” Ant hurried to the she- 


cat’s side. 

They stared hopefully at Tigerheart. 

Taken aback, Tigerheart looked at 
Dovewing. Suddenly their small party 
had become a patrol. He guided 
Dovewing to the side of the den. “What 
do you think?” he whispered. 

“I think that we are traveling with 
young kits.” Dovewing looked past him 
to where Cinnamon and Ant were 
watching hopefully. “They would be 
safer if we had company.” 

“But what will ShadowClan say if I 
return with strangers?” Would they turn 
them away? Tigerheart wouldn’t blame 
them. “They will remember what 
happened when they took in rogues.” 


“These cats arent rogues,” 
Dovewing reminded him. “We have seen 
them fight to protect their denmates, and 
scavenge for others. They take care of 
their sick like Clan cats.” She looked at 
Tigerheart defiantly. “If ShadowClan 
won’t take them in, then ThunderClan 
will.” 

He saw a flash of pride in her green 
gaze. Unease prickled beneath his pelt. 
Here, among the guardian cats, it had 
been easy to forget she was a 
ThunderClan cat. She was clearly still 
fiercely proud of her Clan and shared 
their values. Could she ever learn to live 
as a ShadowClan cat? He pushed the 
thought away. They were both warriors. 


That was enough for now. “Okay.” He 
turned to Cinnamon and Ant. “You can 
come.” 

Cinnamon’s eyes shone. 

Ant looked at Fierce. “We’re sorry 
to leave.” 

“Others will come,’ Fierce 
reassured him. “Ice-chill is here. Your 
nests won’t be wasted.” 

“When are we leaving?” Blaze 
asked excitedly. 

Tigerheart glanced through a clear 
stretch of wall. It was sunhigh and the 
weather was fine. The cold would be 
hard on the kits, but rain would be 
worse. “We leave now.” 

Cinnamon hurried quickly toward 


Mittens and Rascal, touching them each 
on the cheek with her muzzle. Tigerheart 
pressed against Dovewing as they 
watched the guardian cats say good-bye 
to their denmates. Then Ant jumped 
toward the den entrance. Cinnamon, 
Spire, and Blaze followed and waited 
on the wooden ledge for Tigerheart, 
Dovewing, and the kits. 

Pouncekit rushed ahead, leaping 
nimbly onto the ledge. Lightkit jumped 
after her and turned as Shadowkit leaped 
up. His forepaws reached the ledge and 
clung on, his hind legs dangling. 
Tigerheart felt Dovewing stiffen beside 
him. He guessed what she was thinking. 
If Shadowkit couldn’t make such an easy 


jump, how would he manage the long 
journey to the lake? Then Lightkit 
ducked down and nipped Shadowkit’s 
scruff between her teeth. Pouncekit 
reached a paw under his tail and helped 
heave him up. Hope flickered in 
Tigerheart’s belly. Thats how. We’ll 
take care of one another. 

Blaze glanced down at him. “How 
do we get out of the city?” 

Tigerheart returned the young tom’s 
gaze. He’d thought about this night after 
night. There was only one way he could 
be sure that they’d find their way home. 
“We head for the station. We have to find 
the Silverpath that led me here.” 





CHAPTER 28 
Cog 


Cinnamon helped Tigerheart retrace 
the path he’d followed from the station, 
on his way here, a few moons ago. She’d 
lived in this part of the city before she 
joined the guardian cats, so she knew it 
very well. Tigerheart hadn’t walked this 
way since he’d first found the thorn den. 
But as soon as he followed her around 
the final corner, he recognized the tall, 
wide Thundersnake camp. 

He glanced over his shoulder at 
Dovewing and the kits. The walk here 
had been slow. Crossing the 
Thunderpaths had been easier than he’d 


expected. They’d used the green Twoleg 
lights to find gaps in the traffic, and 
carried the kits over by their scruffs. But 
the bustling walkways had been harder 
to negotiate. Dovewing and Ant had 
flanked Pouncekit, Lightkit, and 
Shadowkit; Blaze had walked behind 
with Spire as Tigerheart and Cinnamon 
led the way. Twolegs hardly ever 
seemed to look where they were 
walking, so steering the kits between 
their legs had proved tricky. In the end, 
Dovewing, Spire, and Ant had scooped 
them up, ducking into alleys whenever 
Twolegs seemed to take an interest in the 
strange patrol. 

Crowds of Twolegs flocked at the 


entrance to the station. Monsters 
crawled outside, stopping to let out or 
pick up Twolegs. Tigerheart took the 
lead. He knew where he was going now. 
He skirted the thickest part of the crowd, 
heading toward the alley that led to the 
rot piles Dash had shown him. 

Relief washed his pelt as he ducked 
clear of the thronging Twolegs and into 
the quiet of the deserted alley. He waited 
while Dovewing, Cinnamon, Ant, Blaze, 
and Spire caught up. “You can put the 
kits down now,” he told them. “There 
aren’t any Twolegs here.” 

Dovewing placed Pouncekit on the 
stone path as Ant and Spire put Lightkit 
and Shadowkit down. Her gaze darted 


around warily as she _ gathered 
Shadowkit and Lightkit closer to 
Pouncekit with a swish of her tail. 
“Where now?” she asked Tigerheart. 

“We need to get inside.” Tigerheart 
nodded down the alley. “There’s an 
entrance along here.” 

He knew Dovewing hadn’t been here 
before. She’d found her own way into 
the city, avoiding the long tunnel that had 
swallowed the Thundersnake at its 
outskirts. Instead she’d padded along 
countless streets, wandering for days 
before she’d found the thorn den. What 
would she think when she saw inside the 
Thundersnake nest? Tigerheart 
shuddered, remembering the terrifying 


Thundersnakes, each with its own 
Silverpath. They needed to find the right 
one. If they chose the wrong track, only 
StarClan knew where it might lead. 
Tigerheart pushed back the fear 
pressing in his chest and headed down 
the alley. The three-pawed monster was 
still sleeping at the side. He tasted the 
air as he approached the rot piles, 
pleased to find only Dash’s scent 
lingering there. Mae, Floyd, and Scrap 
had clearly found new territory to 
scavenge. Past the rot piles, he found the 
loose mesh where he and Dash had 
squeezed out. Lifting it with a paw, he 
let the others inside. “Keep going until 
you reach the next mesh,” he called, his 


mew echoing along the narrow tunnel. 
He followed them in, his belly tightening 
as the rush of scents washed over him. 
For a moment, terror gripped him as he 
remembered arriving. The shock of the 
sounds and scents had overwhelmed 
him. They threatened to overwhelm him 
now. But he had to be brave. Dovewing 
and the kits were depending on him. 
“Have you found the mesh?” he called as 
he saw her shape silhouetted against the 
harsh light streaming in at the far end. 

“I think so.” Dovewing’s ear flicked 
nervously. 

He hurried toward her, squeezing 
past Ant, Spire, Cinnamon, Blaze, and 
the kits. Their fear-scent filled the space. 


He pushed against the mesh at the far end 
and let them into the big bright tunnel 
beyond. 

A pair of Twolegs clip-clopped past 
them, heading toward the wider space. 
Tigerheart faced the group. “We have to 
stay bunched tight,’ he warned them. 
“There are a lot of Twolegs here. And 
the lights and scents and movement will 
be disorienting. Don’t lose sight of one 
another. I’m going to lead us to Dash. He 
helped me when I first arrived. He can 
help us find the right Silverpath out of 
here.” 

“Pm not scared.” Pouncekit puffed 
her chest out. But her pelt was bushed. 
So was Lightkit’s. Shadowkit cowered 


against Dovewing’s legs, his eyes wide 
with alarm. 

“Let’s carry the kits.” He scooped up 
Shadowkit, worried at how cold his pelt 
felt. Tucking in his chin to hold the kit 
close, Tigerheart headed along the 
tunnel. 

He retraced the steps he’d followed 
with Dash, eventually leading the cats 
into the great arching space where he’d 
first scented the station cat. Glancing 
past the Twolegs hurrying in every 
direction, he recognized the brightly lit 
Twoleg den at the side of Dash’s nest 
and hurried toward it, hoping that Dash 
would be there. 

The station cat’s scent touched his 


nose. Hope flashed beneath Tigerheart’s 
pelt. Picking up his pace, he headed for 
the gap in the wall where he’d first met 
Dash. He dropped Shadowkit inside as 
soon as he reached it. “Dash,” he called 
into the darkness. 

Yellow eyes blinked ahead of him, 
and Dash’s scent filled Tigerheart’s nose 
as the black-and-white tom scrambled to 
his paws. 

“Tigerheart?” Dash looked alarmed 
as his gaze slid past Tigerheart and 
rested on Dovewing and the others 
crowding behind him. “What are you 
doing here?” 

“I found my friend,” Tigerheart told 
him quickly. He didn’t want to scare the 


station cat. “We need your help.” 

Dash slunk from the shadow and 
squeezed out past Tigerheart. He stared 
in surprise at Shadowkit, Pouncekit, and 
Shadowkit. His ears twitched. “Are 
these yours?” 

“Yes.” He nodded to Dovewing. 
“This is Dovewing, my mate. We’re 
taking them home.” 

“To the forest?” Dash narrowed his 
eyes as he looked at Spire, Blaze, Ant, 
and Cinnamon. “Are they going with 
you?” 

“Yes.” 

Dash tipped his head. “City cats in 
the forest?” He sounded unconvinced. 

Cinnamon flattened her ears. “We 


just need your help, okay? We don’t need 
your opinion.” 

Ant glanced at the Twolegs 
swarming her. “Let’s be polite,” he 
warned Cinnamon. 

Dash was looking at the kits. “Do 
you want me to show you which train to 
get on?” 

Dovewing bristled. “We’re not 
taking our kits into the belly of a 
Thundersnake.” 

“Then how will you get home?” 
Dash looked confused. 

“We'll walk,” Dovewing told him 
firmly. 

“There’s nowhere to walk,’ Dash 
argued. 


Tigerheart shifted his paws. He 
didn’t like lingering here. A strange 
Twoleg yowl was echoing around the 
den. “We’ll walk on the paths the 
Thundersnakes use.” 

Dash’s eyes widened. “You want to 
go into the tunnels?” 

“They lead out of the city, don’t 
they?” Tigerheart blinked at him. 

“It’s dangerous!” 

“T’ve been in tunnels before,” 
Tigerheart meowed breezily. “When 
Thundersnakes came, I just crouched at 
the edge. Thundersnakes never leave 
their path. It’s easy to keep out of their 
way.” Please, StarClan. Protect us. His 
heart seemed to beat in his throat. He 


hoped no one guessed how scared he 
was. 

Dash narrowed his eyes doubtfully. 

“I just need you to help me find the 
Silverpath that brought me here,” 
Tigerheart told him firmly. 

Dash looked thoughtful. “I didn’t see 
which train you came out of, but if you 
lead me to the ledge where you got out, I 
can take you into its tunnel.” 

Tigerheart frowned. “Have you been 


in the tunnels before?” 
“I hunt for rats there,” Dash told him. 
Dovewing’s ears twitched 


suspiciously. “You told us the tunnels 
were dangerous.” 
“I’m used to them,” Dash told her. 


1? 


“Pd never take kits or strays in there 

Cinnamon flattened her ears. “Who 
are you calling a stray?” 

Ant shifted his paws. “He’s just 
worried about us,” he reassured 
Cinnamon. 

Cinnamon huffed. “Well he doesn’t 
have to be rude about it.” 

Dash dipped his head to the orange 
she-cat. “I’m sorry. But there’s a 
difference between a loner hunting the 
tunnels when the trains are sleeping and 
a group of cats and kits trying to find 
their way out of the city. It’s a long 
way.” He looked at Tigerheart. “Are you 
sure you want to walk? Hiding in the 
belly of a train would be quicker.” 


Tigerheart looked at the kits, 
remembering the flurry of Twoleg paws 
as they crowded in and out of the 
Thundersnake. It would be too easy to 
lose them. He shuddered. “We want to 
walk.” 

“Okay.” Dash padded into the 
Twoleg bustle. Tigerheart caught 
Dovewing’s eye questioningly. 
“Ready?” Dovewing nodded. 

Tigerheart picked up Shadowkit 
while Cinnamon and Dovewing grabbed 
Lightkit and Pouncekit. Then they hurried 
after Dash. 


The skinny black-and-white tom led 
them to the large cavern where 
Thundersnakes dozed between ledges. 


Tigerheart scanned them, trying to 
remember which direction he had run 
after leaving the Thundersnake that had 
brought him here. He recognized the 
gaudy Twoleg clutter—Twoleg shells 
and furs—lining the middle of one ledge. 
That was the one. He hurried ahead of 
Dash and led him toward the gap where 
the Thundersnake had stopped. It was 
empty now. Tigerheart peered over the 
edge and saw the Silverpath a few tail- 
lengths below. It led away between the 
ledges and disappeared into a tunnel at 
the end. 

“Is this the one?” Dash asked, 
following his gaze. 

Tigerheart nodded, Shadowkit 


swinging from his jaws. 

“Follow me.” Dash looked around at 
the cats. “Follow me exactly. Only put 
your paws where mine have been. I’ve 
seen rats get burned on the tracks here if 
they touch the wrong one.” 

Twolegs began to gather along the 
ledge. Were they waiting for a 
Thundersnake to arrive? Tigerheart’s 
breath quickened with fear. He had to 
trust Dash. Dash would keep them safe. 
He followed the black-and-white tom as 
he led them along the ledge to where the 
tunnel opened. 

Dash jumped down, landing neatly 
between the tracks of the Silverpath. He 
waited, looking up. “Follow me,” he 


ordered. “One at a time.” 

Cinnamon jumped down first, 
Lightkit swinging in her jaws. Lightkit 
squealed as they fell, whimpering as 
Cinnamon landed with a thump and 
staggered to find her footing. Ant 
followed. Dash waved them quickly 
toward the wall of the tunnel. 
“Remember, don’t touch the tracks,” he 
warned. 

Blaze peered over the edge. “It’s a 
long way down.” His voice was small, 
frightened—the young tom was not much 
bigger than Tigerheart’s own kits, after 
all. 

“Jump toward me,” Dash called. 
“PII help break your fall.” 


Tigerheart saw Blaze swallow as he 
crouched at the edge, his tail trembling. 
Then he launched himself toward Dash. 

The station cat reared and wrapped 
his paws around Blaze as he fell. Deftly 
he swung him down between the tracks, 
then nudged him toward Ant and 
Cinnamon. Spire followed while 
Dovewing teetered at the edge. 

“Don’t drop me,” Pouncekit wailed 
as Dovewing leaped down. As she 
landed, Tigerheart tightened his grip on 
Shadowkit’s scruff and jumped down 
beside her. 

He followed Dash and Dovewing 
into the darkness of the tunnel. Cold 
wind streamed through his fur. It filled 


his nose. Through the stench of 
Thundersnake, he could smell the 
perfume of meadows and woods. The 
city seemed to be drawing in fresh air, 
like a breathing animal. 

Dash slid into the lead. “Follow 
me.” 

Tigerheart put Shadowkit down. 
“You don’t have to come any farther, 
Dash,” he said. “We can follow the 
tunnel to the end.” 

The station cat’s eyes flashed in the 
darkness. “Do you think Pd have a 
moment’s peace knowing you and your 
kits were wandering down here alone?” 
he asked. “I’m staying with you until you 
reach daylight.” 


Tigerheart felt a wave of gratitude 
toward the black-and-white tom, and 
realized that he was surprised at how 
willing Dash had been to help. He’d 
expected a city cat to only care about 
himself. But then he remembered Fog. 
She might have behaved like a rogue, but 
she’d stayed loyal to her group, hadn’t 
she? And he could still remember her 
wail of grief as she’d watched the 
Twoleg carry her brother away. Perhaps 
all cats were warriors at heart. He 
glanced at Cinnamon and Ant. He hoped 
so, at least. 

Stones littered the track, sharp on 
Tigerheart’s pads. His belly tightened as 
Dovewing placed Pouncekit gently on 


the ground. Her paws had known nothing 
but the shiny floor of the gathering-place 
den and the softness of grass outside. 

“I want to walk too.” Lightkit 
wriggled beneath Cinnamon’s chin. 

Cinnamon put her down, and Lightkit 
shook out her pelt. 

“I bet no kits as young as us have 
ever walked along a Thundersnake 
tunnel before,”  Lightkit meowed 
proudly. 

Tigerheart’s chest swelled as she 
lifted her tail high and began to follow 
Dash along the Silverpath. Pouncekit and 
Shadowkit clustered beside her, pelts 
fluffed out against the icy draft. He fell 
in beside Dovewing, staying close at 


their heels. Spire, Blaze, Cinnamon, and 
Ant followed. 

Before long, the dazzling lights of the 
station had disappeared behind them. 
Darkness stretched ahead. Dim, round 
lights flickered from the roof every now 
and then. Twolegs must have fixed them 
there to guide the Thundersnake to its 
den. 

“We begin in darkness and end in 
darkness.” Spire’s mew took Tigerheart 
by surprise. He glanced back at the tom, 
wondering what had made him speak 
now. In the dull glow of a Twoleg light, 
he could see that Spire’s eyes had a 
faraway look. 

Blaze caught Tigerheart’s eye. 


“Don’t disturb him,” he whispered. 
“He’s dreaming.” 

Tigerheart’s pelt prickled uneasily. 
End in darkness. This journey was 
already daunting. Spire’s grim words 
didn’t help. He whisked his tail 
enthusiastically. “We’ll be out of the city 
soon. Pouncekit, have I told you about 
rabbits?” 

Pouncekit glanced back at him. “Are 
they like weasels?” 

Dovewing purred. “Weasels are like 
stoats. Rabbits are like hares.” 

Lightkit’s ears twitched. “It’s so 
confusing. How will we ever learn it 
all?” 

“Don’t worry. It’ll be easier than you 


think.” Tigerheart’s spirits lifted as he 
imagined showing the pine forest to his 
kits. 

Shadowkit gasped, stopping in his 
tracks. His pelt bristled. “What are 
they?” 

Tigerheart followed his gaze. Rats 
were darting across the Silverpath 
ahead. In the dim light, they looked 
slippery and fast. “Thats prey,’ he 
meowed breezily. He didn’t want to 
betray the fear in his belly. Some of the 
rats looked as big as the kits. What if 
there were more? A swarm could 
overrun them, and a bite from their sour 
teeth could be deadly. “We can catch 
some if we get hungry. For now, stay 


close to us. We don’t want rat stench on 
our fur.” 

Dovewing glanced at him. Fear 
tinged her gaze. He pressed closer 
against her, hoping his warmth would 
reassure her. 

Pouncekit halted suddenly. “I can’t 
walk any farther. My paws are too sore.” 
She lifted one of her forepaws and 
lapped her pad gingerly. 

“The stones are rather sharp,” 
Dovewing sympathized. “But we have to 
keep going. There’ll be grass once we 
get to the end. And your pads will 
toughen up as we travel.” 

Ant mewed from behind. “I could 
give her a—what do you call it?—a 


badger ride?” 

Pouncekit turned around eagerly. 
“Can I?” she looked hopefully at 
Dovewing. 

Tigerheart answered. “A warrior 
walks.” 

Dovewing blinked at Tigerheart. 
“She’s not a warrior yet. And the stones 
are sharp.” 

“This will be a long journey.” 
Tigerheart pressed back guilt. This 
wasn’t a time for softness. He had to be 
strong. They all had to be strong. “The 
kits need to learn how to be tough if 
we’re going to reach the lake.” 

Pouncekit sniffed. “Okay. I can be 


tough.” 


Lightkit nudged her sister. “Try to 
imagine what the grass will feel like 
when we get to the end. It will take your 
mind off the soreness.” 

Shadowkit flicked his tail. “Will the 
grass outside the city be like the grass 
near the gathering place?” 

“Grass is the same everywhere—” 
Tigerheart stopped. The breeze had 
stiffened. He heard a familiar hum from 
the track. His heart lurched. A 
Thundersnake was coming. 

Dash must have heard it too. He 
stopped and turned to face the group. 
“We have to crouch down at the edge of 
the tunnel,” he warned. 

Tigerheart could see the bright eye of 


a Thundersnake in the distance. 

Shadowkit blinked at it. “Is that the 
end of the tunnel?” he mewed hopefully. 

“No.” Tigerheart guided him toward 
the wall. “A Thundersnake is coming. 
We have to duck.” 

“Will it squash us?” Pouncekit’s 
mew was shrill with fear. 

“No.” Dash sounded calm. “There’s 
plenty of space. But it will be loud and 
windy.” 

“Flatten your ears as much as you 
can.” Tigerheart’s throat tightened as he 
remembered the Thundersnake that had 
screamed past him in the tunnel on his 
way to the city. What if the wind of this 
snake’s passing whisked the kits away? 


“Hold on to the kits!” he called as the 
roar of the Thundersnake rose around 
them. The Silverpath was singing now as 
it vibrated harder. Wind tugged at 
Tigerheart’s pelt. He grabbed 
Shadowkit’s scruff and tucked him under 
his chest as he flattened himself into the 
corner where the wall met the ground. 
He looked back and saw the others 
pressing themselves hard against the 
stone. Dovewing had Pouncekit’s scruff 
in her jaws and had wrapped her paws 
around the kit. Lightkit’s tail showed 
from beneath Cinnamon’s belly as the 
she-cat sheltered her against the wind. 
Blaze huddled between Spire and the 
wall. Tigerheart flattened his ears. The 


air throbbed around him as the 
Thundersnake pounded closer. He 
screwed his eyes shut. Shadowkit 
trembled beneath him. The ground 
shuddered and the walls rang with the 
howling of the Thundersnake. Its foul 
stench scorched his lungs. As it 
screeched past, the tunnel seemed to 
explode around him. Every hair on his 
pelt shrilled with the clattering roar as 
the earth shook. Stiff with terror, 
Tigerheart waited for it to pass. 

In a few moments, the Thundersnake 
was charging away. The wind swirled, 
then eased into a soft breeze once more. 
The tracks trembled and then grew still. 
Tigerheart pushed himself to his paws 


and forced his fur to flatten. Shadowkit 
shifted beneath him. Tigerheart saw him 
trembling, his eyes wide with terror. He 
grabbed the kit’s scuff and lifted him 
gently to his paws. “It’s gone now. 
You're safe.” 

Shadowkit blinked at him. “I thought 
the tunnel had fallen in.” 

Dash shook out his pelt. “Tunnels are 
used to trains. They never fall in,” he 
promised. 

Lightkit wriggled from beneath 
Cinnamon. “That was exciting!” Her 
eyes shone. 

Pouncekit whisked her tail. “Can we 
wait for another one? I want to do it 
again!” 


Dovewing blinked at Tigerheart. 
“Are you okay?” Her fur was bristling 
with fear. 

“Pm fine. How are you?” 

“I don’t think Pll be able to hear 
properly for days.” Dovewing twitched 
her ears. 

Cinnamon stared after the 
Thundersnake, her flanks heaving. “That 
was horrible.” 

“Tm putting my paws in my ears next 
time.” Ant mewed. 

“That was bigger than all the 
monsters I’ve ever seen,” Blaze 
breathed. He looked at Spire. The skinny 
tom was still lying on his belly. “Are 
you hurt?” 


Spire lifted his nose from between 
his paws. “Was it real?” 

Blaze stared at him. “Of course it 
was real. Can’t you smell it?” 

The air was thick with acrid 
Thundersnake stench. 

“Come on.” Tigerheart began 
walking. He wanted to reach fresh air as 
soon as he could. Air that made his lungs 
burn couldn’t be good for the kits. He 
heard the stones crunch as the others 
hurried after him. Fixing his gaze on the 
shadows ahead, Tigerheart strained to 
see daylight. 

He lost track of time as he pushed 
on. The kits stopped talking. 
Occasionally Ant and Cinnamon 


murmured something to each other. Dash 
hurried ahead from time to time, scouting 
for rats or some sign of the end. Two 
more Thundersnakes howled past. 
Shadowkit trembled harder each time, as 
though each passing reached deeper into 
his fur. Lightkit and Pouncekit seemed 
energized by them, their weariness 
evaporating for a few moments after the 
roar had subsided. 

Spire trailed behind, and Blaze fell 
back to urge him on. “Come on. We’ll be 
in the open soon.” The young tom’s mew 
echoed off the stone walls. 

“Tt feels like we’ve been walking for 
moons,’ Ant mewed grimly. “Are you 
sure there is an end to this tunnel?” 


“Tt can’t be far now,” Tigerheart told 
him, trying to sound convincing. Then his 
eyes blinked as he saw pale light far 
ahead. Another Thundersnake? He 
pricked his ears. There was no distant 
growl. The earth felt still beneath his 
paws. He tasted the air. Fresher scents 
than he’d smelled in moons touched his 
tongue. “We’re nearly there!” His heart 
soared. He quickened his pace. 

Pouncekit hurried ahead, Lightkit at 
her heels. “I want to see outside.” 

“Will we be able to see the lake?” 
Lightkit asked. 

“Not yet.” Tigerheart wondered if he 
should warn them that the lake was days 
away. 


Shadowkit trotted after his sisters. 

Blaze left Spire’s side for the first 
time and caught up with them. His 
ginger-and-white pelt was ruffled with 
excitement. “I’ve never seen outside the 
city.” 

“Nor have I.” Ant sounded excited. 

Tigerheart purred, wondering what 
Ant expected to find. 

Cinnamon and Spire padded after 
them, stumbling a little as the stones 
shifted beneath their paws. 

Dovewing looked at Tigerheart, her 
eyes shining. There was enough real 
light now to see the green of her gaze. 
“We’ve made it out of the city.” She 
looked at the kits as they hurried ahead, 


Dash trotting protectively alongside 
them. She purred loudly. ““We’re going to 
make it back to the lake, aren’t we?” She 
spoke as though this was the first time 
she’d believed it. 

Tigerheart purred back. “Yes.” 

Behind them, Spire was muttering, 
but Tigerheart couldn’t make out the 
words. He didn’t care about the strange 
tom. He just wanted to see the sky. 
Hurrying, he caught up with the kits, and 
before long they were padding out of the 
stinking tunnel into fresh air. A few 
moments later, Spire followed. 

Stars glittered above. A sliver of 
moon hung between them. The dark sky 
reached to the horizon, so wide, 


Tigerheart’s chest seemed to burst with 
joy. He breathed in the scents of trees 
and grass. Dew-scented, the landscape 
stretched before them like a dream. 

Shadowkit blinked at it. “Where are 
the big Twoleg dens?” 

Small Twoleg nests crowded the 
Silverpath. But they nestled low against 
the ground like prey. The only shapes 
that tried to reach the stars here were the 
distant hills. 

Lightkit moved closer to Tigerheart 
as Dovewing, Cinnamon, Spire, and Ant 
caught up to them. “It’s so big.” She 
sounded frightened. 

“And quiet.” Pouncekit pricked her 
ears. Only the cry of a distant owl 


disturbed the peace. “I don’t like it.” She 
blinked at Tigerheart with wide, 
frightened eyes. 

He leaned down and licked her head. 
“You'll get used to it,” he promised. 

Dovewing smoothed her tail along 
Lightkit’s spine. “When you’ve been out 
of the city for a few days, you'll realize 
it’s not so big. And there are plenty of 
noises. The sound of the wind in the 
trees is like the rumbling of distant 
monsters, and the birds chatter like 
Twolegs.” 

“Really?” Lightkit looked hopefully. 

“What’s that funny smell?” Pouncekit 
twitched her nose. 

Tigerheart breathed deep the familiar 


scents of wind and grass. “That’s what 
fresh air smells like.” 

Shadowkit padded along the 
Silverpath for a few paces, then stopped. 
He looked up at the stars twinkling 
overhead. “There are more stars here!” 
His tail twitched excitedly. 

“Wait until we’re far away from the 
Twoleg nests,’ Tigerheart told him. 
“Yow ll see more stars than you could 
ever dream of.” 

Shadowkit blinked at him. “Are 
those our ancestors?” 

Tigerheart nodded solemnly. 

Lightkit looked up and frowned. “We 
have a Jot of ancestors.” 

Dash shifted beside them. “I'd better 


head back,” he meowed. 

Dovewing met his gaze. “Will you 
be okay on your own?” 

“Yeah.” Dash shook out his fur. “P ve 
never been this far, but I’m glad I came.” 

“You can come with us,” Dovewing 
offered suddenly. 

Tigerheart looked at her in surprise. 
Was that a good idea? They would 
already be bringing four strange cats 
back to the Clans. 

“Thanks,” Dash purred. “But I like 
city life.” 

Tigerheart blinked at him gratefully. 
“Thank you, Dash. You have the heart of 
a warrior.” 

“I don’t know about that,’ Dash 


twitched his tail, clearly pleased. “But 
I’ve been glad to help.” He dipped his 
head. “Good luck to you all.” Pausing to 
glance at each cat for a moment, he 
turned and headed into the tunnel. 
Tigerheart stretched. It was good to 
feel the moonlight on his pelt once more. 
It seemed to wash the stench of the city 
from his fur. “Let’s find somewhere to 
make camp for the night.” He looked 
toward the grassy bank beside the track. 
Twoleg nests clustered at the top. But a 
stretch of ground lay beside them, dotted 
with trees. The bushes around their roots 
would provide shelter until dawn. They 
could hunt then and fill their bellies with 
warm, clean prey before they set off for 


the lake. He blinked at Dovewing. 
“We’ll start early tomorrow.” 

She stretched her muzzle forward 
and touched her nose to his cheek. 
“Yes,” she breathed happily. “Tomorrow 
we can head home.” 





CHAPTER 29 
Cog 


The moon showed in the late afternoon, 
pale against a paler sky. It had grown fat 
in the days they’d been walking. A half- 
moon had passed, and each dawn 
brought colder weather. Tigerheart 
fluffed his fur out against it and looked at 
Pouncekit, Lightkit, and Shadowkit. They 
were quiet today, walking close to 
Dovewing. 

“Don’t forget,” she told them softy. 
“If you get a piece of grit in your paw, 
lick it out straight away or it’ Il work its 
way into your pad and hurt.” 

Lightkit’s tail drooped. “My pads 


already hurt.” 

“They’re tougher, though,” Pouncekit 
encouraged. “You stuck one in my 
muzzle while you were sleeping last 
night, and it felt as hard as stone.” 

Shadowkit looked thoughtful. “If our 
pads are tougher, will it be harder for 
grit to get in?” 

“Yes.” Dovewing leaned down as 
she walked and licked him gently 
between the ears. 

“How far is there to go?” Lightkit 
asked. 

Dovewing turned her anxious gaze 
on Tigerheart. 

He glanced at the landscape 
stretching around the Silverpath. The 


Twoleg dens were fewer, dotted now. 
Yesterday they had passed the ledge 
where he’d been pushed into the belly of 
the Thundersnake. He tried to remember 
how many days he’d walked to get here. 
“We just need to keep going,” he 
meowed. “If we make good time, we’ll 
be there for full moon.” 

“Full moon!” Pouncekit flicked her 
tail crossly. “Yesterday you said we’d 
be there before full moon.” 

Traveling with kits was slower than 
Tigerheart had imagined. “We might 
make it home earlier if we don’t 
dawdle,” he told her. 

Cinnamon hurried to catch up to the 
kits. “Why don’t we play a game to make 


the time pass?” 

Lightkit looked at her, brightening. 
“What game?” 

“Let’s make up names for the trees 
and plants and creatures we see, and 
Tigerheart and Dovewing can tell us if 
were right.” Cinnamon looked 
hopefully at Tigerheart. 

He blinked at her gratefully. He’d 
been surprised at how hard she and Ant 
worked to distract the kits. Yesterday, 
Ant had persuaded Pouncekit, Lightkit, 
and Shadowkit to race him as they 
traveled; he had pointed out trees along 
the way and challenged them to reach 
them before he did. The guardian cats 
had also turned out to be useful hunters. 


Tigerheart had wondered how they’d 
manage without scrapcans to scavenge 
from, but they’d adapted easily to 
chasing prey, and their pelts grew 
glossier, their eyes brighter, and their 
muscles tighter each day. 

Blaze was shaping up to be the best 
hunter. Two days ago he’d caught his 
first rabbit. He’d outwitted it by cutting 
across its path, and his killing bite was 
so accurate that it had hardly mattered 
that the rabbit was almost as big as him. 
Hunting was when the young tom seemed 
happiest. During the day, as they walked, 
he kept quiet and stayed close to Spire, 
shadowing the healer protectively. Spire 
hardly spoke, but watched the passing 


fields and hills as though looking for 
something. Tigerheart had the feeling that 
he was making this journey for a reason 
he had left unspoken. He was uneasy that 
the strange tom never shared the dreams 
and visions that seemed so often to cloud 
his gaze. 

“Thorn-thistle!” 

Shadowkit’s mew jerked Tigerheart 
back to the present. He blinked at the kit, 
wondering why he was staring at him so 
eagerly. 

Pouncekit bounced to Tigerheart’s 
side. “He’s guessing a plant name,” she 
explained. She pointed her muzzle to a 
large bush dotted with red hips. 

“That’s sweetbriar,” Tigerheart told 


them. “But thorn-thistle was a good 
guess.” 

Shadowkit puffed his chest out 
proudly. Lightkit wandered across the 
track and climbed the bank to where the 
shrub sprouted from among the browning 
bracken. She sniffed one of the red buds 
that weighted down a stem. “Can we eat 
these?” she asked. 

“T don’t think so.” Dovewing hurried 
to her side. “Jayfeather might use them to 
make medicine, though.” 

“Who’s Jayfeather?” Lightkit blinked 
at her. 

Pouncekit lifted her tail.” Don’t you 
remember? Dovewing told us about him. 
He’s the blind healer cat.” 


Spire’s gaze sharpened suddenly. 
“Healers!” he meowed. “I remember 
now. You said each Clan has healers like 
me.” 

“Kind of,’ Tigerheart told him. 
“Except medicine cats have been trained 
since they were paws.” 

“Will we be ’paws when we get to 
the lake?” Pouncekit asked eagerly. 

“Not straight away,” Tigerheart told 
her. “You have to be six moons old 
before you can become an apprentice.” 

“But you said we’ve walked farther 
than any kits have ever walked.” Lightkit 
padded back down to the track and fell 
in beside her sister. “Doesn’t that mean 
we can start training sooner?” 


Dovewing joined her. “No.” As she 
looked sternly at the kits, Spire suddenly 
stopped. 

Tigerheart glanced back at the skinny 
tom. “Are you tired? We can stop soon 
and hunt. But we need to keep going a 
while longer.” 

Spire’s eyes had misted once more. 
He was staring into the far distance, 
beyond the trees that lined the track to 
the softly rolling hills beyond. 

“We need to leave the track.” His 
meow suddenly rose into a panicked 
wail. “Here! We must leave it here. This 
is where we must find the orange sun.” 

Tigerheart stared at him warily. The 
crazy cat was staring away from the sun, 


which was dipping toward the horizon, a 
red fiery ball. There was no time for 
this. They needed to head home. But he 
didn’t want to argue with the healer. “It 
will be safer if we keep following the 
track.” 

Spire bounded up the bank. “This 
way,” he mewed urgently. “The orange 
sun is this way. We have to find it. They 
need us.” 

Unease prickled through Tigerheart’s 
pelt. What if this vision is important? 

Cinnamon hurried to the healer’s 
side. “Come on, Spire. Let’s stay on the 
track. We don’t want to get lost.” 

Blaze’s pelt lifted along his spine. 
“You have to believe him.” He looked 


pleadingly at the others. “When he’s like 
this, you have to believe him.” 

“But he seems confused to me,” 
Dovewing meowed. “The orange sun’s 
over there.” She pointed to the sunset 
with her muzzle. “Who could possibly 
need us out here? We don’t know any 
cat.” 

“And we’re needed at home.” There 
wasn’t time to chase more visions. And 
Cinnamon was right. What if they left the 
track and couldn’t find their way back? 
How would they ever find their way 
home? 

Blaze squared his shoulders. “We 
have to listen to him.” 

Ant padded forward. “We’re all 


tired and hungry,” he meowed. “Why 
don’t we find a place to spend the night? 
We can hunt and fill our bellies.” He 
glanced at Tigerheart, lowering his 
voice. “Spire’s always had crazy 
visions. In the morning he’ll have 
forgotten about it.” 

Tigerheart’s head felt like it was 
filled with rushing water. He didn’t 
believe that Spire was crazy, but he was 
beginning to wonder if, without proper 
medicine-cat training, the skinny black 
tom really understood his own visions. 

Spire might not be crazy . . . but 
what if he’s wrong? 

Ant was still staring at him 
Tigerheart dipped his head to the small 


brown-and-black tom. “We should rest.” 
As the sun set, the air chilled. The kits 
would be cold, although he knew they 
wouldn’t complain. He could taste ice in 
the wind. The ground would freeze 
tonight, and they would wake to a heavy 
frost. They needed food and a warm 
nest. And maybe it would give Spire 
enough time to think about his latest 
vision—figure out what it meant before 
they decided to go off in search of an 
orange sun. 

He followed Spire up the bank, 
overtaking him as they reached the top. 
A meadow stretched toward the hills. 
Hedgerows bounded it. He saw a patch 
where rowan trees sheltered bushes. 


“We’ll make camp over there.” He 
nodded toward the rowans as the others 
climbed the bank. 

Spire’s eyes glittered with alarm. 
“What about the orange sun?” 

“We can worry about that in the 
morning,” Tigerheart told him. “The sun 
will rise over there.” He nodded toward 
the hills where Spire had wanted to go. 
“We can head toward it then.” 

Spire shifted his paws distractedly. 
“Not the dawn sun!” he snapped. “The 
orange sun!” 

Tigerheart curled his tail around 
Spire. “We’ll find it tomorrow,” he 
soothed, tugging the skinny tom toward 
the meadow. 


When they reached it, Spire settled 
in the roots of a rowan. Blaze walked up 
to Tigerheart, frowning. “He won’t relax 
until he finds it,” he warned. 

“A belly full of food and a warm 
nest will calm him down,” Tigerheart 
promised, staring at Spire. His eyes 
were closed, yet he still seemed to be 
looking at something. 

It’s just because he’s never had any 
cat to help him, Tigerheart told himself. 
Without a mentor, of course he cant 
figure out what his visions mean. We 
are going the right way. 

We have to be.... 


As Tigerheart drifted wearily toward 
sleep, the kits snuggled tighter around 


him. He could hear Dovewing’s tail 
flicking uneasily against the side of their 
makeshift nest. They’d hunted and swept 
leaves into piles to sleep on. Now the 
kits were asleep. Cinnamon and Ant 
were snoring gently, and Spire had 
stopped murmuring to himself at last. 

Dovewing’s tail carried on flicking. 

“What’s wrong?” he whispered. 

“How do you know this isn’t another 
vision about ShadowClan?” 

He lifted his head and blinked at 
Dovewing. Her green eyes were shining 
in the moonlight. “There were no 
shadows in his vision,” he mewed. 

“So you think only some of his 
visions are true?” Dovewing looked 


worried. 

“I think StarClan used him to send 
me a message,” Tigerheart told her. “But 
you've heard him. Even he doesn’t 
always know which parts of his visions 
are useful.” 

Dovewing’s gaze hardened. 

“Then how do you know we’re right 
to be heading back to the lake? What if 
Spire doesn’t have a connection to 
StarClan after all?” 

“He does!” Tigerheart belly knotted 
with frustration. “Or he did.” 

Dovewing stood up, her tail straight 
and her eyes blazing with worry. 
“Tigerheart, what if we’re risking our 
kits’ lives for no reason—” 


“Tigerheart!” Blaze’s anxious 
whisper sounded beside his ear. He 
turned to see the young tom staring over 
the side of the nest. “He’s gone!” 

“Who?” 

“Spire!” Blaze sounded frantic. 
“Spire’s gone! I left the camp to make 
dirt, and when I got back, his nest was 
empty. I think he’s gone to find the 
orange sun.” 

“But it’s nighttime.” Tigerheart slid 
from among the kits. “How does he think 
he’ ll find the sun?” 

Blaze blinked at him, starlight 
shimmering on his pelt. “I told you we 
should have listened to him.” 

“Did you know he’d go running off?” 


Tigerheart fluffed out his fur against the 
icy chill. 

“If Pd known, I wouldn’t have left 
him alone.” Blaze stared past the rowans 
and across the meadow. “I followed his 
scent. He headed that way.” 

Tigerheart flexed his claws. He 
ached from the day’s walk. He didn’t 
want to spend the night hunting for a lost 
cat. 

“We have to find him before he 
freezes.” Blaze’s breath billowed 
around his muzzle. 

“Okay.” Tigerheart wasn’t going to 
let the skinny tom come to harm. He 
blinked at Dovewing. “Stay here with 
the kits. We’re going to look for Spire.” 


Dovewing got to her paws, her fur 
rippling indignantly. “Pm coming too,” 
she growled. “You’re not the only 
warrior in camp.” 

“What about the kits?” 

“Cinnamon and Ant can take care of 
them.” Dovewing leaned into the nest 
and plucked Shadowkit by his scruff. 

The dark gray kit murmured sleepily 
as she carried him to Ant and 
Cinnamon’s nest. “What’s happening?” 

Dovewing placed him between the 
guardian cats. “You and your littermates 
are spending the night in Cinnamon’s 
nest,” she told him briskly. 

Ant opened his eyes. 

“Can you and Cinnamon take care of 


the kits?” Dovewing asked him. “Spire’s 
wandered off and we have to go and find 

Ant blinked at her sleepily. “Okay.” 

Cinnamon lifted her head. “What’s 
going on?” 

“We've got the kits tonight.” Ant 
yawned. “Spire’s wandered off.” 

Cinnamon sat up, her eyes sparkling 
with worry. 

Dovewing fetched Pouncekit and 
dropped her in the nest. “It’s okay,” she 
reassured Cinnamon. “We’ll find him 
and bring him back.” 

Pouncekit looked around blearily. 
“What’s happening?” 

Cinnamon wrapped her tail around 


the kit while Dovewing fetched Lightkit. 
“Don’t worry, little ones. Tigerheart and 
Dovewing are going to look for Spire. 
Go back to sleep.” She drew Lightkit 
close to her belly as Dovewing placed 
her beside Pouncekit. 

“We'll be back soon.” Dovewing 
blinked at the kits, who stared back like 
anxious Owls. “Be good and go to sleep. 
And try not to fidget.” 

“We’ll take care of them,” Cinnamon 
promised. 

Ant stared across the meadow. 
“Spire can’t have gone far, and on a cold 
night like this, his scent should be easy 
to follow.” 

“We'll bring him back.” Dovewing 


turned her tail and joined Tigerheart. 
Tigerheart could smell Blaze’s fear- 
scent. The young tom was pacing 
impatiently around him. “Come on.” He 
headed away from camp. “Show me 
where you picked up Spire’s scent.” 
Blaze hurried ahead, sniffing at the 
ground. “It’s fresh, but he was running. 
Look how he’s scuffed the grass.” 
Tigerheart saw the paw marks. 
Spire’s claws had kicked lumps from the 
frozen ground. He must have been 
moving fast. “He won’t be able to keep 
that pace up for long.” He broke into a 
trot. He was annoyed with the skinny 
tom. Spire had made him and Dovewing 
argue. Now he’d gotten him out of his 


warm nest in the middle of the night. It 
would do the dumb cat good to freeze a 
little. 

Dovewing padded beside him as 
they crossed the moon-drenched 
meadow. Blaze kept a little way ahead, 
trying to push the pace but slowing each 
time he looked back and saw Tigerheart 
lagging. Tigerheart felt a prick of guilt as 
Blaze reached the foot of the hill. The 
young cat was worried. It wasn’t fair to 
let him suffer just because Spire was 
being difficult. 

He picked up his pace, Dovewing 
trailing him as he caught up to Blaze. 
The slope grew quickly steeper. Heather 
sprouted among rocks as the grass grew 


rougher beneath his paws. Soon they 
were following a gritty trail between 
wind-hewn stones. “Can you still smell 
his scent?” he asked Blaze. 

“Can’t you?” Blaze flashed him a 
look. 

Tigerheart didn’t want to admit that 
the guardian cats smelled so much like 
the Twoleg tang that had infused their 
den, he’d never really been able to tell 
their scents apart. Only now that wind 
and rain had washed the city smell from 
them was he beginning to recognize 
Cinnamon’s and Ant’s smells when they 
were out of sight. He wondered, with a 
spark of alarm, if he’d have the same 
problem with his Clanmates when he got 


home. Would the pungent smell of 
pinesap overwhelm him now? 

“Look!” Dovewing nudged his flank 
as she caught up to him. She was staring 
along the trail. The stones opened onto a 
rocky rise. Above it, an owl circled. 
“Maybe we shouldn’t have left the kits.” 
The owl was huge, its wingspan as long 
as a branch. 

“They’re hidden beneath the rowans, 
and Cinnamon and Ant are with them,” 
Tigerheart told her, anxiety pricking in 
his pelt. “Besides, the owl’s here, not 
back there.” 

Blaze fell in beside them, his gaze 
following theirs. “Why is it circling? Do 
you think it’s spotted prey?” He glanced 


at Tigerheart with round, frightened 
eyes, and Tigerheart guessed what he 
was thinking. A small, skinny tom like 
Spire would be easy for an owl that big 
to carry off. 

“Let’s hurry.” He avoided Blaze’s 
question and scrambled to the top of the 
slope. He crossed the summit quickly 
and gazed into the valley below. A 
Thunderpath ran along the bottom. It was 
wide where the ground flattened 
between the hills. A lone monster was 
heading into the distance, its blazing 
eyes the only Twoleg light in the 
landscape. 

He scanned the grass on the slope 
below, searching for movement. “Can 


you see him?” he asked Blaze. 

“No.” Blaze’s fur ruffled in the 
breeze. 

“Whats that?” Dovewing’s mew 
made Tigerheart stiffen. Had she spotted 
the tom on the hillside? He followed her 
gaze to a shape looming beside the 
Thunderpath. It looked small from up 
here, but he guessed that it was as big as 
the side of a Twoleg nest—a tall, flat, 
solitary wall, facing the Thunderpath. 
Dovewing narrowed her eyes. “Why did 
Twolegs build a wall there? Is it a signal 
for the monsters?” 

Blaze was staring at it. “It has 
shapes on it, like the shapes Spire used 
to draw in dirt sometimes to show me 


what his visions looked like.” 

Tigerheart strained to see. The flat 
surface of the wall was shaded with 
color that he couldn’t make out in the 
moonlight. 

Blaze hurried suddenly forward. 
“Spire’s scent!” 

Tigerheart followed the young tom as 
he raced down the hill. The coarse grass 
felt slippery beneath his paws as Blaze 
led him zigzagging between rocks and 
heather. He was out of breath by the time 
they reached the side of the Thunderpath. 

Dovewing pulled up behind him, 
panting. She scanned the valley. “Did he 
follow the Thunderpath or cross it?” 

Blaze ducked and sniffed the grass, 


following a trail over the grass. He 
stopped and lifted his tail. “He crossed 
here.” The young tom stood opposite the 
Twoleg wall, which loomed on the other 
side. 

Tigerheart blinked at the colors that 
stained the wall, frowning as he tried to 
make out a picture. In the moonlight, the 
stains looked gray, but he realized, with 
a jolt, that the shapes were familiar. The 
great Twoleg wall had been stained to 
look like a city skyline, and above the 
jagged roofs Tigerheart saw the shape of 
a big, round sun. He stared at it, surprise 
bristling through his fur. Could this be 
the orange sun Spire had meant? 

Blaze was already crossing the 


deserted Thunderpath. The young tom 
stopped beneath the wall and gazed up at 
it. “This must be his vision!” He spun 
around, searching. “Spire’s scent is 
here.” 

Dovewing blinked at Tigerheart. “I 
guess he’s been right all along.” Was that 
relief in her gaze? 

“Come on.” Tigerheart led the way 
across the Thunderpath. It sparkled 
where frost was beginning to creep over 
the smooth stone. He stopped below the 
stained wall. Blaze was sniffing the 
bottom eagerly. 

Tigerheart pricked his ears. He 
could hear cats talking nearby. He 
stiffened, alarm sparking in his belly. 


“There are cats behind the wall,” he 
hissed to Blaze. 

Blaze lifted his muzzle, pausing as 
he listened. “It’s Spire,” he mewed. 
“He’s talking to some cat.” 

“Who would be out here?” 
Dovewing stared at the young tom. 

As she spoke, Tigerheart’s pelt 
prickled. An unexpected jab of longing 
made him stiffen as scents that he hadn’t 
smelled in moons touched his nose. His 
heart quickened as he followed Blaze 
around the wall. On the moonlit grass 
behind, he saw Spire with two cats. 
Blaze stopped and stared at his friend. 
The healer seemed to be trying to beckon 
the strange cats away from a dip in the 


grass where they’d made a nest. 

“You don’t have to stay here,” Spire 
called. “I can take you to my friends.” 

Tigerheart looked past Spire and 
saw a familiar pelt. “Rippletail?” The 
tom’s white pelt looked nearly blue in 
the moonlight. 

Rippletail jerked his gaze toward 
Tigerheart, his eyes widening with 
shock. “Tigerheart?” 

“You're alive!” Tigerheart hadn’t 
seen Rippletail since the battle with 
Darktail. Rippletail had stayed in 
ShadowClan when Darktail’s rogues had 
taken over. After the battle, he’d 
disappeared along with several other 
members of ShadowClan. Tigerheart had 


assumed they must be dead. What else 
would have kept a warrior from his 
Clan? What else? Tigerheart stiffened, 
fear hollowing his belly. 

Dovewing stopped beside 
Tigerheart, her pelt bristling. “Is that 
Rippletail?” She paused as her gaze 
flicked to a second figure in the shadowy 
dip behind Rippletail—his _ sister, 
Berryheart. 

Tigerheart couldn’t believe his eyes. 
He padded closer until he could make 
out the she-cat’s black-and-white pelt. 
His former Clanmate was clearly 
thriving, because she’d grown fat since 
leaving ShadowClan. He froze. She isn t 
fat—shes expecting kits! Which meant 


maybe Sparrowtail was with them too! 

He narrowed his eyes as a thought 
crept into his mind. Why hadn’t these 
cats returned to their Clan? He fixed 
Rippletail with an icy stare. “Are 
you... rogues now?” 





CHAPTER 30 
Cog 


Rippletail stared back. “Rogues? No!” 
Shock edged his mew. “Is that what 
ShadowClan thinks?” 

“Our Clanmates think you’re dead.” 
Anger hardened Tigerheart’s mew. “Why 
have you let them grieve for so long?” 
His gaze flitted from Rippletail to 
Berryheart. “You are Snowbird and 
Scorchfur’s kits. Can you imagine their 
pain?” 

Berryheart pressed close to her 
brother, her gaze shimmering with hope. 
“They still have Yarrowleaf, don’t 
they?” 


“We think she went with the rogues 
after the battle with Darktail.” A bone- 
chilling wind swept down the hillside 
and bit through Tigerheart’s pelt. 

Berryheart blinked in disbelief. “We 
thought she’d returned to the Clan!” 

“Like you did?” Tigerheart curled 
his lip. 

Rippletail stepped forward, 
shielding his sister. Alarm glittered in 
his eyes. “We meant to, eventually, but 

“You betrayed your Clan!” 

As Tigerheart bristled, Dovewing 
brushed against him. “Be gentle,” she 
murmured. “We don’t know what they’ ve 
suffered.” 


Guilt jabbed Tigerheart’s belly. 
Dovewing was right. Moons had passed 
since these warriors had left their Clan. 
And hadn’t he left ShadowClan too? 
Perhaps they had their reasons for 
staying away, like he had. He dipped his 
head to Berryheart and Rippletail. “I’m 
sorry. You’re not responsible for your 
littermate’s decision. But ShadowClan 
has lost so many. Mistcloud, Lioneye 
and Spikefur . . .” Berryheart’s eyes 
widened with horror as Tigerheart went 
on. “Please tell me Sparrowtail’s with 
you, at least.” 

Rippletail pricked his ears. 
“Sparrowtail and Cloverfoot are with 
us!” 


“They are?” Tigerheart breath caught 
in his throat. 

Rippletail nodded toward a shadow 
on the hillside. “We’ve been living up 
there. In an abandoned Twoleg nest.” 

“Are Sparrowtail and Cloverfoot 
there now?” Tigerheart could hardly 
believe his ears. He’d found four of 
ShadowClan’s missing warriors. 

“They're hunting,’ Rippletail told 
him. “We were getting ready to go out 
ourselves when this cat found us.” He 
nodded to Spire. The healer was gazing 
blankly toward the abandoned Twoleg 
den. 

Blaze stood beside him, staring at 
Rippletail and Berryheart with wide 


moonlit eyes. “Are these warriors too?” 

“They were Clanmates once,” 
Tigerheart told him Were they 
Clanmates now? 

Rippletail went on. “Sparrowtail is 
the father of Berryheart’s kits.” 

Dovewing padded forward and 
blinked kindly at the queen. “When are 
they due?” 

“Soon.” Berryheart shifted her paws 
nervously. 

Rippletail narrowed his eyes as he 
stared at Tigerheart. “What are you 
doing here? Why are you traveling with 
them?” He looked suspiciously at 
Dovewing, Blaze, and Spire. 

Blaze puffed out his chest. “Im 


going to be a warrior. And Spire is 
going to be a medicine cat.” 

If only it were that simple. 
Tigerheart glanced at the young tom, 
imagining all the questions and 
recriminations that might be waiting at 
the end of their journey. “It’s a long 
story,’ he told Rippletail. He felt 
suddenly tired. What would Rippletail 
think when he discovered that he and 
Dovewing had kits waiting for them on 
the other side of the hill? “Too long to 
tell here.” 

As he spoke, paw steps thrummed 
across the frozen hillside. Tigerheart 
recognized the shapes of Cloverfoot and 
Sparrowtail at once. Lit by the moon, 


their pelts gleamed as they raced closer. 

Cloverfoot called out anxiously from 
the darkness. “Rippletail? Berryheart? 
Who’s with you?” The gray tabby she- 
cat pulled up, blinking in surprise at 
Tigerheart. 

Sparrowtail scrambled to a halt 
beside her. A fat rabbit dangled from his 
jaws. He dropped it as he saw 
Tigerheart. “What are you doing here?” 
His surprised gaze flitted to Spire and 
Blaze. “Who are you?” 

Rippletail fluffed out his pelt. “Let’s 
have this conversation somewhere 
warmer.” 

Berryheart’s eyes were clouding 
with tiredness. She blinked gratefully at 


her brother. 

“Lets go back to our den.” 
Cloverfoot nodded toward the 
abandoned Twoleg nest as Sparrowtail 
hurried to Berryheart and pressed his 
muzzle against her cheek. 

Dovewing glanced anxiously at 
Tigerheart. “The kits,” she whispered. 
“They'll be worried about us.” 

Blaze whisked his tail. “Ant and 
Cinnamon will want to know that Spire’s 
Okay.” 

“Ant and Cinnamon?” Cloverfoot 
frowned. 

Berryheart pricked her ears. “Kits?” 

Rippletail padded between the cats, 
his tail flicking. “I guess you do have 


quite a story to tell.” 

Spire flicked his tail impatiently. 
“The past is irrelevant. Now that we’ve 
found you, you must come with us.” 

“Where to?” Rippletail looked 
alarmed. 

“To the Clans, of course,” Spire 
meowed. 

Rippletail and Sparrowtail 
exchanged anxious looks. 

“We’ve been worried about going 
home,” Cloverfoot explained. “We 
joined the rogues. We fought the Clans. 
We werent sure ShadowClan would 
have us back. That’s why we’ve stayed 
away.” 

Tigerheart returned the gray tabby’s 


gaze. After such disloyalty, any cat 
would find it hard to return to the Clan 
they’d betrayed. But ShadowClan was in 
trouble. Doubt fluttered in his belly. 
Could he trust them? He met 
Cloverfoot’s eye. “Would you join the 
rogues again?” he asked. 

Her eyes flashed in alarm. 
Sparrowtail and Berryheart pressed 
together. 

Rippletail lifted his chin. “Never.” 
His meow was unflinching. “We made a 
terrible decision. We didn’t realize that 
Darktail was a liar and a bully. We truly 
thought he could make ShadowClan 
stronger and safer. We were wrong. And 
we will spend our lives making it up to 


ShadowClan, if they agree to take us 
back.” 

“They may not have much choice,” 
Tigerheart meowed grimly. “We lost so 
many warriors to the rogues that we 
didn’t have enough to patrol our 
territory. We gave some of it to SkyClan. 
The remaining cats lost faith in 
Rowanstar, and I... I left the Clan to 
give hima chance to be leader.” 

Rippletail looked confused. “But 
you're his son! You were always 
Rowanstar’s strongest ally.” 

“I was causing trouble for the Clan 
just by being there,” Tigerheart told him 
bluntly. “My Clanmates were looking to 
me for orders. It undermined 


Rowanstar’s leadership. I thought 
Rowanstar had more chance of keeping 
the Clan together without me. And 
Dovewing . . . was expecting my kits. 
We traveled far, to a territory with many, 
many Twolegs, so she could give birth in 
a place where no cats could judge us.” 
He looked around the ShadowClan cats, 
daring them to criticize him. After all, 
he’d not only left his Clan, but he’d had 
kits with a warrior from ThunderClan. 
But there was truth in his curt 
explanation—and none of them were ina 
position to criticize the choices he’d 
made. And Tigerheart felt sure that he 
would make the same choice all over 
again, if he had to. 


Sparrowtail glanced past Tigerheart. 
“Where is your camp?” Clearly he 
didn’t want to dwell on the past. “If you 
have kits, we should go to them.” 

Blaze blinked at him. “Are they 
coming back to the Clans with us?” 

Tigerheart looked at them. “Are 
you?” 

Cloverfoot, Sparrowtail, Berryheart, 
and Rippletail exchanged glances, then 
nodded. “We’re ready to go home,” 
Rippletail meowed. 

Dovewing padded anxiously around 
Berryheart. “Are you well enough to 
travel?” Her gaze flicked over the 
queen’s swollen flanks. 

Spire answered for her. “It’ll be 


easier for her to travel with the kits 
inside her belly than outside,” he 
meowed matter-of-factly. 

Berryheart’s eyes flashed with 
amusement. “Your friend is right.” She 
padded forward heavily. “I’m afraid I 
may slow you down. But if I wait until 
the kits are born, it may be moons before 
we can travel back to the lake.” 

Tigerheart huffed in reluctant 
agreement. “Let’s go back to our camp,” 
he meowed. “We can rest for the night.” 
He glanced at Cloverfoot’s rabbit. Its 
warm prey-scent was bathing his tongue. 
“You can eat and rest there, and we can 
start the journey home in the morning.” 

Spire glanced up.  Tigerheart 


followed his gaze, his eyes resting on the 
stained wall looming above them. He 
dipped his head to the skinny tom. “The 
orange sun,” he said. “You were right.” 


Two days of rain were followed by a 
crisp, bright day. Blue sky stretched 
toward the horizon. White clouds 
whisked across the sky, driven by a 
brisk, chilly wind. Tigerheart followed 
the Silverpath around a wide, curving 
valley, Dovewing padding at his side. 
There were only a few Twoleg nests 
dotted among the frosty meadows here. 
Spire kept his distance from the track, 
eyeing it warily from time to time. Blaze 
stayed close to him, glancing back at 
Rippletail and Berryheart. 


The queen had slowed down their 
pace as she’d predicted. Her swollen 
belly made her breathless, and she tired 
easily. Pouncekit,  Lightkit, and 
Shadowkit scampered ahead with 
Rippletail and Cloverfoot. They’d been 
excited to meet ShadowClan warriors 
and seemed eager to impress them. Ant 
and Cinnamon seemed pleased too, and 
asked their new traveling companions 
almost as many questions about Clan life 
as the kits did. Tigerheart hadn’t told any 
of them that the last time he’d seen these 
warriors, they were fighting alongside 
rogue cats who had threatened to destroy 
all the Clans. He eyed Rippletail now, 
his pelt pricking with an unease that 


hadn’t left him since they’d found their 
former Clanmates. 

Dovewing brushed against him as 
they walked. She followed his gaze 
toward Rippletail. “You’ve forgiven 
them, haven’t you?” She sounded 
uncertain. 

“We all make mistakes,” Tigerheart 
murmured. “But I keep thinking of the 
moment when the rogues came, and our 
Clanmates”—the word felt bitter on his 
tongue—‘‘didn’t lift a paw to stop 
Rowanstar, Tawnypelt, and me from 
leaving the camp. They wanted us to go. 
They chose Darktail instead.” 

Dovewing turned her soft green gaze 
on him. “That must have felt terrible. But 


things have changed. They know they 
were wrong.” 

Tigerheart shook out his pelt. He 
knew he must get rid of the resentment 
worming beneath his fur. If ShadowClan 
was to survive, past grievances must be 
forgotten. “When I left ShadowClan, 
there was so little trust in the Clan. I’m 
worried that bringing traitors back will 
only make it worse.” 

Dovewing flicked her tail. “For a 
start, you have to stop thinking of them 
as traitors.” She watched Pouncekit duck 
beneath Cloverfoot’s belly and pop out 
the other side. Lightkit ducked after her, 
purring. “They are clearly sorry for the 
choices they made. You’re helping to 


reunite your Clan. You need to show by 
example that old wounds can heal and 
old arguments can be forgiven.” 
Tigerheart’s thoughts flitted back to 
the city cats. He remembered Fierce’s 
reluctance to hold grudges. Her easy 
acceptance of other strays. He 
remembered Tuna’s words. In the city, 
its rare to have anything long enough 
to defend it. Perhaps the Clans had been 
trying too hard to hold on to the past. “I 
thought I had nothing to learn from the 
guardian cats,” he meowed thoughtfully. 
“But they’ ve learned to live with change. 
It might be easier to live life the way it 
is now than to try to keep it the way it 


99 


was. 


Dovewing nudged her shoulder 
softly against his. “You’re starting to 
sound like a leader,” she murmured 
teasingly. 

He met her gaze. “Am I?” He 
remembered Rowanstar’s offer to step 
aside and make him leader of 
ShadowClan. He hadn’t felt ready then. 
Did he feel ready now? He pushed the 
thought away. It had brought swirling 
with it memories of Spire’s dark vision. 
The shadows are fading. He can't keep 
them together. Was there a ShadowClan 
left to lead? 

“Tigerheart!” Shadowkit’s mew 
distracted him. The gray kit had stopped 
and was waiting for Tigerheart and 


Dovewing to catch up to him. Lightkit 
and Pouncekit had rushed ahead, batting 
an acorn between the tracks. “Rippletail 
wanted to know if we are going to be 
ThunderClan cats or ShadowClan cats.” 
He gazed inquisitively from Tigerheart 
to Dovewing. 

Dovewing answered. “We don’t 
know yet,” she told him. “We’ll decide 
when we reach the lake.” 

There may be no ShadowClan to 
join. Tigerheart was relieved that 
Dovewing hadn’t mentioned this 
possibility. Why worry the kits about 
something that might not be true? 

“Can we choose?” Shadowkit fell in 
beside his father. “Because I think Pd 


choose ShadowClan.” 

“Why?” Tigerheart looked at his son. 

“I don’t know.” Shadowkit shrugged. 
“I just feel like ShadowClan needs me. 
And I am called Shadowkit.” 

Tigerheart smoothed his tail along 
the kit’s spine. “When we reach the lake 
and see the Clans again, we’ll decide 
where you and your sisters should live. 
And when you’re old enough to start 
your training, you can decide for 
yourself which Clan you prefer.” 

“Is that what all Clan kits do?” 
Shadowkit asked. 

Tigerheart thought of Violetpaw and 
Twigpaw. “No,” he answered. “But it 
happens from time to time. Especially 


when kits are born outside the Clans.” 

Shadowkit frowned. “Will the other 
cats think we’re strange?” 

Before Tigerheart could answer, a 
yowl split the air. Tigerheart jerked his 
muzzle toward the bank. Spire was 
staring at the Silverpath, his eyes lit with 
panic. “It’s coming! Too fast! Quick! It’s 
coming! It’s too fast!” 

Tigerheart pricked his ears. He 
heard the distant rumble of a 
Thundersnake. The tracks began to hum. 
Why was the healer making such a fuss? 
Thundersnakes passed them several 
times a day. “Every cat get off the 
tracks,” he called. 

As Sparrowtail guided Berryheart to 


the safety of the grassy bank, Ant, 
Cinnamon, Cloverfoot, and Rippletail 
hopped from the tracks. Dovewing 
grabbed Shadowkit’s scruff and hurried 
to join the others. Like a fox darting from 
the shadows, a Thundersnake appeared 
from behind a rise. It was moving fast. 
Tigerheart’s belly tightened as he 
saw Lightkit and Pouncekit chasing their 
acorn toward it. Hadn’t they heard him? 
“Get off the tracks!” The Thundersnake’s 
roar drowned his cry. Heart lurching, he 
raced toward the kits. “Run!” They 
turned as he yowled again, blinking first 
at him and then at the Thundersnake. 
Pouncekit’s eyes widened in terror. 
She scrambled away from the acorn, 


tripping over the track. Tigerheart 
reached her and scooped her up, racing 
to the bank to drop her. He turned back 
for Lightkit. She was frozen between the 
tracks. The Thundersnake pounded 
toward her, moving faster than any 
Tigerheart had ever seen. 

“Lightkit!” He hared toward her, but 
black fur flashed past him. Spire pelted 
onto the Silverpath as the Thundersnake 
howled closer. With a yowl drowned by 
its roar, the healer dragged Lightkit from 
the track. The Thundersnake screeched 
past. Its wind hit Tigerheart like a wall 
of water. As he staggered, he saw 
Lightkit tumble toward its flashing paws. 
Spire, pelt plastered against his thin 


frame, grabbed her scruff between his 
teeth. She clung to the ground, the 
Thundersnake tearing at her pelt as Spire 
gripped her, ears flat, belly pressed 
against the earth. 

Horror surged beneath Tigerheart’s 
pelt as he watched, and then, as suddenly 
as it had appeared, the Thundersnake 
passed and roared away into the 
distance. Lightkit scrambled to her 
paws, her pelt bushed. “Tigerheart!” She 
raced toward him, her eyes wide with 
terror, and huddled against his belly as 
he wrapped his tail around her. 

Dovewing rushed to their side. She 
was trembling almost as hard as Lightkit. 
“Tt nearly killed her.” Her mew was 


breathless. She hauled Lightkit toward 
her, pressed her close, and licked her 
head fiercely. 

“Didnt you hear it coming?” 
Tigerheart stared at the kit, his heart 
pounding. 

“We were playing with the acorn.” 
Lightkit’s eyes glittered with shock. 

“It was going so fast.” Pouncekit 
hurried toward them, Shadowkit at her 
heels. ““We didn’t have time.” 

As Dovewing pulled the kits close to 
her and purred quick, desperate purrs to 
reassure them, Tigerheart hurried toward 
Spire. The healer was pushing himself 
stiffly to his paws. 

Blaze was already at his side. “Are 


you hurt?” 

“Tm fine.” Spire shook out his pelt 
and gazed along the Silverpath. 

“You saved my kit.” Gratitude 
swelled in Tigerheart’s throat. 

Spire met his gaze. His eyes were 
dark with foreboding. “Next time, I 
might not be able to.” 

“Next time?” Tigerheart bristled. 

“If we stay on the Silverpath, there 
will be death.” He held Tigerheart’s 
gaze. “Death too quickly. Death without 
meaning.” 

The cold wind seemed to reach 
Tigerheart’s bones. He shivered. 

“We have to leave the Silverpath.” 
Spire stared at him unblinking. 


Ant reached them, Cinnamon at his 
side. “What did he say?” 

Berryheart, Sparrowtail, Rippletail, 
and Cloverfoot crowded around 
Tigerheart, Blaze, and the healer. 

Death without meaning. Fear 
tightened Tigerheart’s belly as Spire’s 
words burrowed deeper. 

“That was close,”  Rippletail 
murmured. 

“Is Spire okay?” Berryheart’s pelt 
pricked anxiously. 

“Why was the Thundersnake running 
so fast?” Cloverfoot asked. 

Blaze glanced around them. He 
ignored their questions. “Spire says we 
have to leave the Silverpath.” 


Cloverfoot blinked. “But Tigerheart 
said it leads to the lake.” 

“We’ll have to find another way,” 
Blaze told her. 

Should we follow Spires advice? 
Tigerheart’s mouth grew dry. 

Rippletail shifted his paws. “That 
was scary,” he mewed. “But all it means 
is that we have to be more careful. 
There’s no need to leave the Silverpath.” 

“We'll get lost if we leave it,” 
Berryheart agreed. 

Sparrowtail moved closer to his 
mate. “We need to get back to the lake 
before Berryheart starts kitting. We can’t 
risk losing our way.” 

Spire’s gaze was still fixed on 


Tigerheart. “We have to leave the 
Silverpath,” he repeated. “If we don’t, 
cats will die.” 

Tigerheart avoided the anxious looks 
of the others. “But we don’t know how 
to get to the lake without the Silverpath 
to guide us,” he told Spire. 

“T know.” Spire didn’t move. 

Tigerheart blinked. “But yov ve 
never even left the city before. How can 
you know?” 

“My dreams will show me the way.” 

Berryheart stiffened. “I know he’s 
some kind of medicine cat—somehow— 
but . . . are we sure he knows what he’s 
talking about?” 

Blaze glared at the black-and-white 


queen. “His dreams found you, didn’t 
they?” 

Tigerheart’s thoughts quickened. 
Leaving the Silverpath was risky. They 
could follow the sunset. But what if the 
Silverpath changed direction and headed 
away from the sunset? Why didnt I pay 
more attention to which way I was 
heading when I left the lake? He should 
have watched the sunsets and made sure 
to remember the changing landscapes. 
But he’d followed the Silverpath 
blindly, like a squirrel chasing a trail of 
beechnuts. 

He searched Spire’s gaze. He’d 
listened to this cat’s dreams before: the 
falling tree, Rowanstar’s voice. And his 


vision of the orange sun had led them to 
the ShadowClan cats. “Do you really 
think your dreams can lead us home?” 

“I know they can,” Spire answered 
firmly. 

Fear trickled along Tigerheart’s 
spine. J have to trust him. 

Rippletail grunted. “I hope you’re 
right.” 

“He is.” Tigerheart held Spire’s 
gaze. “He dreams with StarClan.” 

Blaze lifted his tail. “Are we going 
to let Spire lead us?” 

“Yes.” Tigerheart dipped his head. 
He thought of Lightkit, so close to the 
paws of the Thundersnake. His heart 
quickened. He wasn’t risking her life 


again by staying on the Silverpath. 
“We’ll follow Spire.” 





CHAPTER 31 
Cog 


Tigerheart tracked Spires and Blaze’ 
scents under the hedge that bordered the 
sheep meadow. His paws were mucky 
from crossing. The sheep were crowded 
at the far end of the field, but the ground 
here had been churned to mud by their 
paws. Dovewing was guiding Pouncekit, 
Lightkit, and Shadowkit around the 
stickiest patch, helped by Ant and 
Cinnamon, but Tigerheart had hurried 
ahead, anxious not to lose sight of Spire 
and Blaze as they headed through the 
beech wood beyond. 

Rippletail, Cloverfoot, Berryheart, 


and Sparrowtail were already following 
them between the trees. The bare 
branches filtered sunshine, which 
dappled the golden forest floor. 
Tigerheart glimpsed Blaze and Spire 
beyond them, padding between the trees, 
and looked back to make sure Dovewing 
and the kits were okay. Dovewing was 
nosing Pouncekit beneath the hedge. Ant 
followed the kit through and turned to 
help Lightkit and Shadowkit over the 
roots while Dovewing and Cinnamon 
squeezed through on either side. 
Pouncekit raced into the woods, her 
tail high. “It’s so crunchy!” she 
squeaked, padding happily over the 
near-frozen layer of dry leaves. Lightkit 


and Shadowkit hurried after her, their 
paws clogged with mud. Tigerheart 
caught Dovewing’s eye. She looked 
weary. “Do you want me to stay close to 
you and the kits for a while?” he asked. 

“No.” She peered between the trees. 
“Keep your eye on Blaze and Spire. 
They’re moving so fast.” 

Spire had been pushing ahead 
relentlessly, and the other cats always 
seemed to be trailing behind. Tigerheart 
wondered if the healer had forgotten that 
he had a queen and kits with him. The 
days of walking had been hard for them 
all. But at least the rain, which had 
started to fall soon after they left the 
Silverpath, had stopped now. It had 


rained for two days, and as the fields 
and meadows had become muddier 
underpaw, Tigerheart had increasingly 
wondered whether they’d been wise to 
leave the Silverpath. The stones there 
had been hard on every cat’s pads, but 
trudging over sucking earth was 
exhausting. 

Cloverfoot had stopped and was 
sitting at the foot of a tree while 
Berryheart caught her breath. “Can you 
ask him to slow down again?” 
Cloverfoot asked Tigerheart as he 
neared. “Berryheart can’t keep up this 
pace.” 

“I will.” Tigerheart looked back at 
the kits. Lightkit scooped up a pawful of 


dust and flicked it over Shadowkit. As it 
fluttered around him, the gray tom lifted 
his muzzle to the sky and sneezed. 
Pouncekit ran and skidded through a pile 
of dry grass. “There’s no time to play!” 
Tigerheart called. 

Pouncekit looked up from the grass 
and blinked at him sadly. “But it’s so 
nice here. Can’t we stop for a bit?” 

“Not today.” Tigerheart could see 
Spire and Blaze disappearing over a 
rise. Why was Spire hurrying? Did 
ShadowClan need them so badly? Or 
was Spire just eager to get Berryheart 
home before she kitted? He left 
Berryheart and  Cloverfoot with 
Dovewing, Cinnamon, Ant, and the kits 


and quickened his pace. He’d catch up 
with Spire and ask him to slow down. 
The woods thickened, and shadows 
striped the forest floor. As Tigerheart 
rounded a juniper bush growing between 
the trunks, he heard Rippletail and 
Sparrowtail. He could see their pelts 
through the branches. They had stopped 
and were talking in hushed tones. 
Tigerheart paused and pricked his ears. 

“What if that weird tom has got it all 
wrong?” Sparrowtail snorted. 

“I don’t like the way he talks to 
himself,” Rippletail mewed. “He stares 
into space and mumbles as though 
someone’s listening. I’ve never seen a 
medicine cat act that . . . crazy.” 


“I don’t think Spire’s crazy,” 
Sparrowtail sounded worried. “But I 
don’t think he knows where he’s going, 
either. That stream he made us cross 
yesterday was dangerous. Berryheart 
nearly fell off the log. The water would 
have swept her into rocks.” 

“He could be leading us anywhere,” 
Rippletail murmured, her voice weary. 

“What if we never find our way back 
to ShadowClan? The kits are due soon. 
What if Berryheart kits before we get 
home?” 

Tigerheart backed away. He didn’t 
want them to know he’d been listening. 
He wish he could reassure them, but as 
they trekked farther and farther from the 


Silverpath, he too had begun to doubt 
whether Spire truly knew where he was 
headed. 

He climbed the rise where Spire and 
Blaze had disappeared and saw them 
halfway down the slope below. Breaking 
into a run, he bounded after them, 
breathless by the time he caught up with 
them. 

“Hi, Tigerheart.” Blaze greeted him 
with a flick of his tail. “Is everyone 
okay?” 

“Berryheart and the kits are 
struggling to keep up,” Tigerheart told 
him. 

Spire stopped and blinked at him, his 
gaze vacant. 


“Did you hear me?” Irritation 
flickered through Tigerheart’s fur. “You 
need to slow down.” 

“TI cant,” Spire answered 
distractedly. ““There’s no time to waste.” 

Anxiety pressed Tigerheart’s belly. 
“Is ShadowClan in trouble, or are you 
worried about Berryheart kitting before 
we reach the lake?” 

Spire frowned without focusing. “I 
don’t know. I only know that something 
is tugging me forward, and we mustn’t 
delay.” 

“Are you sure you know where 
you're going?” Tigerheart asked Spire. 
He saw worry flash briefly in Blaze’s 
eyes. It alarmed him. If Blaze had 


doubts, then something must be very 
wrong. 

Spire lashed his tail. “Of course I 
know,” he snapped. “I told you.” 

“But how do you know?” Tigerheart 
pressed. “Do you dream tomorrow’s 
route every night?” 

“No,” Spire meowed curtly. “But I 
can feel when we’ re on the right path.” 

“So we’re going wherever you feel 
is best?” Tigerheart’s paws pricked with 
alarm. They might be wandering around 
the hills for moons. 

Spire began walking. “We must 
hurry. There’s a river ahead. Crossing 
will be dangerous. But we must keep 
going.” 


Tigerheart saw brightness beyond the 
trees where the beech woods ended. He 
strained to see between them. Could 
Spire see water? Land stretched beyond, 
rising toward hills. His worry deepened. 
“Are you sure there’s a river?” 

Spire flashed him a look, then 
headed on. 

“Blaze.” Tigerheart held the tom 
back with a paw. “Do you think we’re 
making a mistake, letting Spire lead?” 

Blaze avoided his gaze for a 
moment, as though he was thinking. Then 
he blinked at Tigerheart. “I trust him.” 

Tigerheart dipped his head. They had 
come this far because of Spire’s vision. 
They might as well keep going. What 


else could they do? 

He followed Blaze and Spire to the 
edge of the wood and waited there while 
they carried on, crossing the wide field 
beyond. Spire veered to one corner of 
the field, heading for a dip that curved 
around the foot of the hill. Sparrowtail 
and Rippletail caught up with Tigerheart 
and paused beside him. They stared 
across the field at Spire. 

“Where’s he heading now?” 


Rippletail asked. 

“He says there’s a river ahead,” 
Tigerheart told him. 

“I don’t see any river.” Rippletail 
grunted. 


Sparrowtail glanced back into the 


woods. “Let’s wait for the others.” 

As Berryheart padded heavily from 
between the trunks, Sparrowtail hurried 
to meet her and fell in beside her. 
Dovewing, Ant, Spire, and the kits 
followed, Cloverfoot close behind. 

“Can we rest soon?” Dovewing 
asked as she saw Tigerheart. 

Tigerheart glanced at the sky. The 
sun was sliding toward the horizon, but 
there was still a way to go until sunset. 
“There’s still plenty of traveling time 
left before dark.” 

“The kits are tired.” Dovewing 
glanced across the field toward Spire 
and Blaze. “They need to rest.” 

“Pm not tired!” Pouncekit lifted her 


chin, but Tigerheart could see weariness 
in her face. 

“Do you want a badger ride?” he 
asked. 

Her eyes shone. “Yes, please!” 

“PII carry Lightkit,’ Cloverfoot 
offered. 

Dovewing looked gratefully at the 
she-cat. 

Ant stooped beside Shadowkit. “Do 
you want to ride on my back?” he asked. 

Shadowkit scrambled onto the tom’s 
shoulders and snuggled against his fur. 

Tigerheart crouched so that 
Pouncekit could climb onto his back. 

“How many more days do you think 
we'll be traveling?” Dovewing mewed 


softly to Tigerheart. 

“I don’t know.” Tigerheart shifted 
his weight as he walked so that 
Pouncekit was balanced comfortably 
between his shoulder blades. “I lost 
track of where we were as soon as we 
left the Silverpath. But Spire seems to be 
in a hurry to get to the lake.” 

“Do you think he really knows the 
way?” Dovewing asked. 

“I hope so.” Tigerheart gazed at the 
horizon, hoping to recognize the shape of 
a distant hill. But nothing seemed 
familiar. He had to believe Spire would 
find the way. 

They trekked on, and as they rounded 
the curve of the hill, Tigerheart saw a 


river meandering along a wide valley 
floor. Relief washed his pelt. “Spire 
said a river lay ahead,” he told 
Dovewing. “He must know where we’re 
going.” Crossing will be dangerous. He 
didn’t dwell on the healer’s words. 

The river was almost as wide as a 
lake. It flowed smoothly between tree- 
lined banks, brown and muddy. The 
water swirled, streams and eddies 
betraying the powerful currents that 
churned beneath the surface. 

“Look!” Pouncekit squeaked from 
his shoulders. “A floating monster!” A 
large, pawless monster  chugged 
upstream, sending wide ripples in its 
wake. Twolegs moved around near the 


top. 

Dovewing looked at the river. “Is 
Spire planning to find a way around it?” 
The healer was heading downstream 
along the bank. 

Tigerheart glanced at her. “He said 
we had to cross it.” He didn’t tell her the 
healer’s warning. 

“Can we cross it in a floating 
monster?” Pouncekit asked excitedly. 

“No.” Tigerheart never wanted to be 
in the belly of another Twoleg monster. 
He glanced beyond Spire and saw a 
large Twoleg bridge spanning the river. 
Monsters prowled over it. “I think he’s 
planning to use that.” It must be a 
Thunderpath, like the one that arced over 


the herb patch in the city. 

Spire was already climbing the 
slope that reached toward the end of the 
bridge. At the top, the healer stopped 
and turned to watch the rest of the party. 
His tail flicked impatiently as he saw 
them trailing behind. 

Dovewing’s gaze was fixed on the 
bridge. “How will we get past all those 
monsters?” 

Tigerheart let his flank brush hers. 
“We survived monsters in the city,” he 
meowed encouragingly. “We can survive 
these.” 

Rippletail, Berryheart, Sparrowtail, 
and Cloverfoot were already beside 
Spire when Tigerheart and Dovewing 


reached them. Ant and Cinnamon caught 
up a few moments later. 

The healer was sitting on the grass 
that edged the Thunderpath. As 
Tigerheart eased Pouncekit from his 
shoulders, he glanced along the line of 
monsters flowing across the bridge in 
both directions. They lurched, growling 
as they sped up; fumes billowed from 
their tails as they slowed down. 
Tigerheart slid in front of Pouncekit 
protectively. He could see that a narrow 
walkway edged the Thunderpath as it 
crossed the bridge, but a high fence 
hemmed it in. His pelt  prickled 
nervously at the thought of being trapped 
between monsters and a wall. “We 


should wait till sundown,” he suggested. 
“There may be fewer monsters then.” 

Spire narrowed his eyes as he 
followed Tigerheart’s gaze along the 
bridge. “We can’t wait. We’re already 
behind. We have to keep going.” 

Rippletail and Sparrowtail 
exchanged glances. 

Ant put Shadowkit down and padded 
a few steps closer to the bridge. “It’s a 
bit cramped,” he mused. “But no worse 
than a Thundersnake tunnel.” 

As he spoke, clanging filled the air. 
Tigerheart’s pelt bushed as Twoleg 
lights began to flash above him. The cats 
bunched protectively around Berryheart 
and the kits as the monsters halted 


beside them and, with a clatter, two long 
fences began to descend like slow- 
falling trees across both ends of the 
bridge. 

“Whats happening?” Cloverfoot 
jerked her muzzle around, eyes wide 
with alarm. 

Dovewing pulled Pouncekit, 
Lightkit, and Shadowkit close to her 
chest as monster fumes rolled over them. 

Cinnamon peered between the thin 
slats of the fallen fence. The stretch 
beyond was clear right up to the fence at 
the far end. “We should cross it now.” 

“Before the monsters clog it up 
again.” Rippletail hurried toward the 
fallen fence and squeezed between the 


slats. He beckoned the others toward 
him with a flick of his tail. 

Tigerheart hesitated. “Is it safe?” He 
looked at Spire, remembering his words. 
Crossing will be dangerous. 

“We have to get across. There’s no 
time to lose.” Spire followed Rippletail 
and slid between the slats, Blaze at his 
tail. 

Dovewing glanced questioningly at 
Tigerheart, the kits sheltering beside her 
flank. 

“Come on.” Tigerheart led her to the 
fence. “There are no monsters.” 

Berryheart was already heaving her 
wide belly between the slats after 
Sparrowtail. Ant and Cinnamon slid 


through either side. As they followed 
Rippletail, Spire, and Blaze across the 
bridge, the monsters behind them began 
to honk like geese. 

Tigerheart’s chest tightened. 
“Quick.” He glanced back and saw 
Twoleg faces staring in horror. “I think 
they’re angry.” He nudged Pouncekit 
through the fence while Shadowkit, 
Lightkit, and Dovewing squeezed 
through the slats on either side. Relief 
washed his pelt as he led Dovewing and 
the kits across the clear stretch of 
Thunderpath. Behind them, the monsters 
honked harder. Why were they so 
furious? 

A hard silver strip spanned the stone 


halfway across. Tigerheart hopped over 
it, worried it might be a trap. Berryheart, 
Sparrowtail, Ant, and Cinnamon were 
almost at the far side. Rippletail and 
Cloverfoot were already squeezing 
through the fence. 

“Hurry!” As Tigerheart called over 
his shoulder to Dovewing and the kits, 
the stone jerked beneath his paws. 
Alarm sparked through his fur as the 
Thunderpath began to lift. It tipped 
beneath his paws, turning the flat stone 
into a slope slanting down toward the 
flat stretch of Thunderpath where 
Rippletail and Cloverfoot watched, pelts 
bristling. 

Whats happening!  Tigerheart’s 


thoughts whirled as he struggled to keep 
his balance. He looked back to where 
the silver strip had marked the halfway 
point of the bridge. There, the bridge had 
cracked and opened like a stick snapping 
in half. Dovewing yelped beside him 
and gripped the rapidly slanting 
Thunderpath. Lightkit and Shadowkit 
squealed in panic. Below them 
Berryheart, Sparrowtail, Ant, and 
Cinnamon leaped clumsily down onto 
the stretch of flat stone where Blaze and 
Spire had already landed. 

Tigerheart gasped as Lightkit and 
Shadowkit plummeted past him. 
Cinnamon reared and caught Shadowkit. 
Rippletail reached out and wrapped his 


paws around Lightkit. 

Tigerheart flattened himself against 
the stone, clinging with his claw-tips as 
he watched Dovewing desperately trying 
to scrabble up the slope. “Where are you 
going?” he yowled. “We need to get off 
the bridge now!” 

“Pouncekit!” Terror filled in 
Dovewing’s cry. 

Tigerheart looked up. Pouncekit was 
teetering at the top of the slope where 
the bridge had cracked in the middle. 
Her ears flat, she wailed with terror. 

Fear-scent pulsed from Dovewing. 
“She’s going to fall through the gap!” 

“Pouncekit!” Tigerheart’s breath 
caught in his throat as Pouncekit tumbled 


out of sight. His belly lurched. Shes 
gone! He tore at the stone, trying vainly 
to haul himself closer. Pouncekit! 
Horror shrilled beneath his pelt as he 
scanned the top. 

Two small paws showed against the 
silver strip. Hope flashed in his chest. 
Pouncekit was clinging on. He tried 
again to heave himself toward her, but 
his claws couldn’t dig into the stone. 
Dovewing wailed desperately as she 
slipped farther away from her kit. 

Suddenly, claws scraped the stone 
beside him. Spire’s black pelt flashed 
past. Scrambling higher, the healer 
leaped for the top of the raised bridge. 
He must have pushed off from the flat 


stretch of stone with such power that 
momentum carried him forward. The 
healer hooked his paws over the end of 
the bridge. He churned the stone with his 
hind paws and managed to pull himself 
up so that he was balancing at the top. 
Hindquarters trembling, he leaned over 
and hauled Pouncekit up, then let her 
drop toward Dovewing. With a squeal, 
Pouncekit tumbled past. 

Tigerheart watched the kit fall, his 
heart in his throat. As Ant stretched to 
catch her, relief flooded his pelt. The 
tom grabbed Pouncekit and swung her 
safely onto the Thunderpath. 

“Spire!” Dovewing’s anguished cry 
made Tigerheart look up again. The 


bridge was still rising, so steep now that 
Tigerheart couldn’t keep his grip. As he 
began to slide, he saw Spire wobble at 
the top. The skinny black tom opened his 
mouth in a wail that never came. As he 
swayed backward and fell, silence filled 
the space where he’d been. 





CHAPTER 32 
Cog 


“Spire!” Disbelief swept Tigerheart. 
He cant be gone! The stone of the 
Thunderpath scoured his belly as he slid 
down the bridge. Landing with a thump, 
he stared blindly at the top. 

Dovewing dropped beside him, 
grunting as she landed. “Pouncekit.” She 
rushed to her kit and began washing her 
frantically. 

Tigerheart couldn’t move. “Spire.” 
His mew came as a helpless whisper. 

“We have to get off the bridge.” Ant 
nudged his shoulder. 

Tigerheart blinked at him. “What 


about Spire?” 

“He’s in the river!” Blaze had 
already dashed to the edge of the 
Thunderpath and was scrambling down 
the steep grass bank to the water’s edge. 

Rippletail, Cloverfoot, and 
Cinnamon streamed after him while 
Sparrowtail steered Berryheart, 
Dovewing, and the kits to the side of the 
Thunderpath. 

Tigerheart’s mouth was dry. “He 
can’t swim.” The river was so huge. 
How could any cat survive? 

“Come on.” Ant nosed him forward. 
“He might have made it to the bank.” 

Tigerheart could hardly believe what 
was happening. He ran numbly after Ant, 


his paws slipping on the grass as he 
followed the others down the bank. 

Blaze was leaning out over the 
swirling water, scanning the surface 
desperately. 

Cinnamon and Cloverfoot scurried 
beneath the bridge, their gazes fixed on 
the river. Tigerheart stared blankly at the 
floating monster, which was gliding 
through the gap the raised bridge had 
made. Water whirled at its flanks and 
churned at its tail. Dread hollowed 
Tigerheart’s belly. Even if Spire had 
survived the drop and managed to swim 
to the surface, the monster would have 
chewed him up. 

“I can’t see him!” Panic edged 


Blaze’s mew. He paced up and down, 
straining harder to glimpse the black 
tom. 

Had Spire foreseen this? Had he 
known when he suggested the crossing? 
Why didnt he find another way? 
Tigerheart swallowed back the grief 
threatening to overwhelm him. He 
couldn’t give up. Blaze would need him. 
The whole patrol would need him. He 
had to be strong. There was no sign of 
Spire. No black pelt showed on either 
bank. The river had taken him. 

He padded to Blaze’s side and 
waited until the young tom stopped 
pacing. Pain glittered in the young tom’s 
amber eyes as he gazed over the muddy 


water. The floating monster was gone. 
Above them, the bridge was slowly 
lowering its legs. Tigerheart heard the 
clatter of the fences lifting and the 
rumble of monsters moving once more. 
“He saved Pouncekit,” he murmured. 
Blaze turned on him, helpless grief 
twisting his young face. “Why didn’t he 
find another way to cross the river?” 
Tigerheart held his gaze. “There was 
no other way.” The river stretched wide 
on either side for as far as the eye could 
see. He touched his nose to Blaze’s ear. 
“We will remember him. StarClan will 
remember him.” Tigerheart glanced at 
the darkening sky where the first stars 
were beginning to show. “His visions 


helped me and Dovewing, and they led 
him to Clanmates I thought were lost 
forever.” 

Rippletail padded to his side. “How 
are we going to find our way now that 
Spire is gone?” Worry darkened the 
white tom’s gaze. 

Blaze bristled. “Oh, now you believe 
him?” He glared at Rippletail. “Spire 
died trying to Help you. Are you only 
bothered that we don’t have a guide 
anymore?” 

Rippletail dropped his gaze. “Of 
course not, but how will we find where 
we...” 

As his mew trailed away, 
Sparrowtail padded forward. 


“Rippletail meant no disrespect.” He 
glanced toward Berryheart, who had 
climbed down the slope with Dovewing 
and the kits and waited now beside the 
others. “But we need to get home before 
Berryheart starts kitting.” 

“Especially now that we’ve lost 
Spire.” Cinnamon stood at Blaze’s side. 
“He was the only healer with us.” 

“We should go back to the 
Silverpath.” Cloverfoot’s tail twitched 
anxiously. “We know it leads to the 
lake.” 

“It would take too much time to 
retrace our steps,” Ant argued. 

“But we might be wandering forever 
without a guide.” Cinnamon gazed 


across the river. “Surely it’s better to 
travel longer and be sure of getting 
where we’re going.” 

“I think we should keep going this 
way.” Blaze pointed his muzzle toward 
the side of the valley where the 
Thunderpath cut between hills. “Spire 
said a Twolegplace lies that way and we 
must travel around it.” 

“But where do we head after that?” 
Tigerheart searched the young tom’s 
gaze. 

Blaze looked at the ground. “Spire 
didn’t say.” 

Tigerheart paused, willing his heart 
to feel less heavy. “I came past a 
Twolegplace when I left ShadowClan,” 


he mewed hopefully. “Maybe this 
Twolegplace is the same one... .” 

“I guess we could keep going,” 
Cinnamon conceded. “If we get lost, we 
can still retrace our steps to the 
Silverpath later.” 

Cloverfoot’s pelt prickled along her 
spine. “We could be walking for 
moons.” 

“We’ve traveled so far already.” 
Dovewing’s green eyes shone in the 
dying light. “We must be getting closer to 
the lake. Surely we’ll see it soon.” 

Tigerheart glanced around at the 
patrol. Doubt darkened every gaze. 
“We’ll follow the route that Spire 
began,” he meowed firmly. “He would 


not have set us on this path if he thought 
we couldn’t reach the end.” 

Ant shifted his paws. “Spire would 
have known we’d find our way.” 

Cinnamon and Blaze nodded. 
Cloverfoot, Berryheart, Sparrowtail, and 
Rippletail mumbled in reluctant 
agreement. 

Lightkit glanced nervously to where 
the Thunderpath cut between the hills. 
“Are we going to follow the monsters to 
the Twolegplace?” 

“No.” Tigerheart nodded to the hill 
rising beside it. Trees and bushes 
covered the slope. The ground would be 
soft underpaw and provide shelter. 

Rippletail followed his gaze. “It 


looks like a good place for prey.” 

Tigerheart glanced at Dovewing. 
“Are the kits okay?” Pouncekit, Lightkit, 
and Shadowkit were clustered beside 
her. They looked at him with wide, 
wotried eyes. 

“They’re fine, but it’s been a long 
day,” Dovewing mewed. “We should 
make camp soon.” 

“Once we’re away from the river.” 
Blaze glanced at the flowing water, fresh 
pain in his eyes. 

“Let’s travel until sunset and then 
hunt and rest for the night,’ Ant 
suggested. 

“Okay.” Stiffening his shoulders, 
Tigerheart led the party away from the 


river. With each paw step, his grief at 
losing Spire deepened, and his regret at 
ever having doubted him stuck in his 
belly like a claw trying to rip its way 
through. 

Spire might not have grown up 
among the Clans, he thought, but if we 
make it back to the lake, if ShadowClan 
is restored, then he’ll have done more 
for our Clan than some of our own 
warriors. 

He pushed on as the slope grew 
harder, and ducked between swaths of 
bracken. No cat spoke as they walked. 
The wind stirred the trees and bushes 
around them as they headed into thicker 
vegetation. Soon they were climbing 


through a stretch of forest. Birds began 
their evening song, calling from the 
branches above their heads. The moon 
rose, burning a patch in the darkening 
sky, and as they reached a clearing in the 
trees, Tigerheart stopped. 

“Are we going to make camp?” 
Rippletail stopped beside him. 

Tigerheart gazed between the trees. 
Far below, the wide river reflected 
moonlight. The image that had burned in 
his mind since they’d left its banks 
burned stronger still—Spire lifting 
Pouncekit to safety, then swaying and 
disappearing . . . giving his life for cats 
he hadn’t known very long, and for a 
way of life he had never known at all. 


“We should honor him.” 

Rippletail blinked at him in surprise. 
“What?” 

Blaze hurried closer. “Are you 
talking about Spire?” 

“Yes.” Tigerheart watched his kits 
pad to a halt. They looked tired, but they 
were safe. “Spire saved Lightkit from 
the Thundersnake and Pouncekit from the 
river,” he meowed. “He was as brave as 
any warrior, and we should honor him as 
a warrior.” 

“How?” Cloverfoot frowned. 

Sparrowtail tipped his head. 
“Should we sit vigil for him tonight?” 

“A vigil is not enough to thank him 
for what he has done.” Tigerheart 


glanced at his Clanmates. “He was loyal 
and brave. He should become one of 
us.” 

Rippletail glanced at the stars. 
“How?” 

“Lets have a warrior naming 
ceremony for him now and give him a 
warrior name.” 

Blaze pricked his ears. For the first 
time, grief cleared from his gaze. “A 
warrior name?” 

“But he’s dead,” Cloverfoot pointed 
out. “It’s too late.” 

Tigerheart stepped from the shadow 
of the trees and let moonlight wash his 
pelt. “StarClan knew him. They will be 
watching. They will know, and once he 


has his warrior name, he’ll be able to 
walk among them as the warrior he has 
always been, even though he never had 
the chance to live as one.” 

“But youre not a leader,” 
Sparrowtail meowed. “How can you 
give a cat their warrior name?” 

Dovewing padded forward. 
“Tigerheart is leader of this patrol.” 

Berryheart sat down wearily. “How 
can a cat who’s never known 
ShadowClan be a ShadowClan 
warrior?” 

Blaze blinked at her. “He’s known 
you, and Tigerheart and Ripple—” 

Cloverfoot cut in. “It’s true. He has 
known our Clan through us. And by 


finding us and protecting Tigerheart’s 
kits, he’s done more for ShadowClan 
these past moons than we have.” 
Exactly, Tigerheart thought. Guilt 
sparked in Cloverfoot’s gaze as she 
looked from Berryheart to Rippletail and 
Sparrowtail. Then she blinked 
expectantly at Tigerheart. “I think he 
deserves a warrior name.” 

Rippletail dipped his head. “Okay.” 

Sparrowtail and Berryheart nodded 
in agreement. Tigerheart lifted his 
muzzle to the stars. “I, Tigerheart, deputy 
of ShadowClan and leader of this patrol, 
call upon my warrior ancestors to honor 
Spire. He never knew the warrior code, 
and yet he lived by it. He healed the sick 


and protected the weak. He gave his life 
to save another. I commend him to you as 
a warrior of ShadowClan, and from this 
moment forward, he will be known as 
Spiresight, for his visions and his 
wisdom.” 

“Spiresight.” Blaze breathed his 
friend’s new name. 

“Spiresight!” Dovewing called out, 
her gaze sparkling as she looked at 
Pouncekit. 

“Spiresight! Spiresight!” The cries 
of the patrol drowned out the evensong 
of the birds as they celebrated 
Spiresight’s warrior name. 

Tigerheart looked once more toward 
the river. As the cries of the others died 


away, he prayed silently to StarClan. / 
hope he is safe among you now. Honor 
him. One day I hope to walk beside 
him. 

He opened his eyes and looked at the 
gathered cats, all of their eyes alight 
with excitement—it felt good to be 
enacting a Clan custom after so long. 

Ant shifted his paws self- 
consciously. “Should we hunt now?” 
The brown-and-black tom furtively 
scanned the undergrowth around the 
clearing. 

Tigerheart could hear the rustle of 
prey. Squirrel scent touched his nose. 
The kits would be hungry. “Yes.” 

“Pm staying here.” Blaze fixed 


Tigerheart with a solemn stare. 
“Sparrowtail said you honor fallen 
warriors by sitting vigil. I want to sit 
vigil for Spiresight.” 

Tigerheart dipped his head. “Once 
the kits have eaten and have warm nests 
to sleep in, I will sit vigil with you.” 

As Blaze blinked at him gratefully, 
Berryheart grunted with pain. 

Dovewing hurried to the queen’s 
side as Berryheart sank to her belly. 
“What’s wrong?” 

Berryheart gave an anguished moan. 
“The kits! I think they’re coming.” 


Tigerheart kept out of the way while 
Berryheart wailed and grunted through 
the night. He sat with Blaze a little way 


from the nest Sparrowtail and 
Cloverfoot quickly made for the queen 
and watched Rippletail and Ant hurry 
back and forth, soaking moss in a nearby 
stream, fetching sticks, pacing anxiously 
while Dovewing and Cinnamon 
crouched around Berryheart, trying to 
help with her kitting. Cinnamon looked a 
little nervous. 

Blaze did not speak as the moon 
moved above the trees. The young tom 
seemed lost in thought, making his silent 
vigil for his friend while the others 
bustled nearby. 

Tigerheart’s thoughts wandered 
between grief for Spiresight and worry 
for Berryheart. How could the kits come 


now? They were not even close to 
ShadowClan’s borders; the landscape 
was unfamiliar, the journey ahead 
uncertain without Spiresight to guide 
them. He waited for worry to deepen 
into fear. And yet, as the night wore on, 
his anxieties unraveled into relief. 
Spiresight was in StarClan now, safer 
than he’d ever been in life. Berryheart’s 
kits would be with them by morning. 
There was no use in worrying. He 
knew what must be done. Newborn kits 
could not travel. The patrol would stay 
here until Berryheart’s young were 
strong enough to finish the journey their 
mother had begun. This wooded hillside 
was not a bad place to wait; the stream 


Ant had found ran nearby, bubbling 
down from the hilltop, fresh and clear. 
The forest had the clean crisp smell of 
wildness, untainted by the Thunderpath, 
which was too far away even to hear. 
Prey would be fresh, and the trees would 
provide shelter even if the weather 
hardened from frost to snow. 

When he heard the mewl of 
Berryheart’s first kit, a sense of peace 
enfolded Tigerheart for the first time in a 
moon. He remembered the first happy 
days with Pouncekit, Lightkit, and 
Shadowkit. Since there was nothing to 
do but wait, he might as well relish the 
comforts of their temporary home. As 
dawn began to lighten the sky beyond the 


hill, he climbed higher to see the rising 
sun. A rabbit strayed across his path, and 
he tracked and hunted it with a simple 
relish he’d not felt since he’d been an 
apprentice. He laid the rabbit at his 
paws and lifted his gaze to watch the 
orange crown of the sun lift above the 
distant hills. 

“Tigerheart?” Dovewing’s mew 
sounded between the trees. 

He didn’t move, but shifted to make 
room as she joined him. “How is 
Berryheart?” 

“She’s well. The kitting was hard, 
but she was brave.” Dovewing sat 
down. “She had three kits. She’s 
suckling them already.” 


“Has she named them?” 

She leaned against Tigerheart, her 
flank warm against his. “Hollowkit, 
Sunkit . . . and Spirekit.” 

“Spirekit?” Tigerheart stared at her. 

Dovewing stretched her forelegs. 
“Berryheart insisted; no other name 
would do.” 

Tigerheart pondered this. It was not 
very common for kits to be named after 
dead cats, but when he thought of 
bringing another Spire back to 
ShadowClan, he purred happily. “I think 
that’s a perfect name. Have you told 
Blaze?” 

“Yes,” Dovewing murmured. “He 
went straight to Berryheart’s nest to see 


them.” 

Tigerheart looked anxiously into 
Dovewing green eyes. “Do you think 
Blaze will be okay? Spiresight cared for 
him ever since he was born.” 

“He will grieve,” Dovewing told 
him gently. 

“Do you think he regrets coming with 
us to ShadowClan?” 

“Not for a moment.” Dovewing 
turned her gaze toward the rising sun. 
“Spiresight wanted him to come, 
remember? I think Blaze will feel he is 
honoring his best friend’s wishes as well 
as his own.” 

Tigerheart touched his nose to 
Dovewing’s cheek. She was gentle in 


her wisdom. 

Dovewing purred for a moment, then 
paused. “It’s strange how Spiresight 
found Berryheart and the others.” 

“I suppose he was guided by 
StarClan,” Tigerheart murmured. 

“I wonder if StarClan guides many 
cats beyond the lake. . . .” Dovewing met 
his gaze. “Or do they just touch cats lost 
warriors will encounter?” As she 
paused again, Tigerheart wondered what 
she was trying to say. “Do you think we 
were meant to travel to the city?” She 
blinked at him, sunlight flaming in her 
green gaze. 

Tigerheart had never wondered if 
StarClan had sent Dovewing’s dreams. 


He’d assumed they were the anxieties of 
an expectant mother, and he’d followed 
because he’d trusted Dovewing’s 
instinct. But she could be right. He 
remembered, with a shiver, Spiresight’s 
strange greeting when they’d first met in 
the gathering-place den. Now they’re 
both finally here. He blinked at 
Dovewing. “I think you may be right.” 
His pelt prickled. “I was alone when I 
left ShadowClan, but I will return with 
Clanmates, both new and old. And 
ShadowClan needs warriors more than 
ever.” He felt the tug of home like a 
claw in his belly. / am coming, 
Rowanstar. His father needed him. 

Can I wait while Berryheart’ kits 


find their traveling paws? Tigerheart 
flicked his tail. UH have to. He’d found 
old Clanmates, and he wasn’t going to 
risk losing them again by leaving them 
here. When he returned to ShadowClan, 
he would bring with him enough cats to 
make the Clan strong once more. He 
lifted his face to the rising sun. You’ll be 
proud of me, Rowanstar, I promise. Just 
hold on until I reach you. 





CHAPTER 33 
Cog 


Tigerheart pricked his ears. Ahead the 
bracken—still stiff from the morning’s 
frost—crackled. He dropped into a 
hunting crouch. 

“We don’t need more prey.” Behind 
him Cloverfoot stood over the squirrel 
they’d already caught. Blaze held a fat 
pigeon between his jaws. 

“Hush.” Tigerheart flicked his tail 
impatiently to quiet the tabby she-cat. 
“Berryheart needs as much food as we 
can catch until the kits are fully 
weaned.” 

A moon old now, Hollowkit, Sunkit, 


and Spirekit had tasted their first prey. 
But although they were growing fast and 
exploring farther from their nest each 
day, they still suckled at night. 

The bracken crackled again. Pelt 
prickling excitedly, Tigerheart leaped. 
He dived between the fronds and 
clamped his paws over a mouse. It 
twitched in panic as he hooked it toward 
him and gave it a killing bite. Its musky 
scent made his mouth water. Even now, 
nearly two moons after leaving the city, 
the taste of forest prey still filled him 
with pleasure. He wondered if he’d ever 
get the taste of scrapcan trash off his 
tongue. He lifted the mouse and carried 
it back to Cloverfoot. 


She purred. “Are you enjoying 
hunting for your Clan again?” 

“I never really stopped.” Tigerheart 
dropped the mouse beside the squirrel. 
“The guardian cats were like a Clan to 
me. But there’s no honor in scavenging. 
When I bring my Clanmates forest prey, I 
feel I am feeding them prey worthy of 
them.” 

He picked up the mouse and headed 
toward the temporary camp they’d built 
between two swaths of bramble. They 
had dug nests among the roots and 
dragged bracken to make a low camp 
wall where the brambles didn’t reach. 
Berryheart’s nest was deepest inside the 
bush, safe from nosy predators. This 


stretch of hillside had sheltered them 
peacefully. Owls called where the forest 
deepened into oak and birch, and foxes 
screeched in the valley below, but 
Tigerheart had never scented predators 
on the territory he’d marked around the 
camp. 

He hadn’t declared himself leader of 
their tiny Clan, but no one questioned his 
orders, and it was to Tigerheart they 
looked to organize the daily hunting and 
border patrols. Cinnamon had managed 
to build a small store of herbs, 
remembering, with the help of Blaze, the 
sight and scent of the leaves Spiresight 
and the other healers had used. Luckily, 
no cat had fallen ill, despite the cold 


weather. Cinnamon had treated an 
occasional bellyache and sore throat, but 
her skills hadn’t been stretched beyond 
mild ailments. 

The cats were rested by the enforced 
break in their journey, and Tigerheart 
sensed relief in Dovewing’s gaze as she 
watched Pouncekit, lLightkit, and 
Shadowkit play in the shelter of the 
camp. He’d felt relief too. The long days 
of walking had been hard on the kits. But 
as the moon had worn on, impatience 
had begun to itch beneath his pelt. 
Rowanstar’s message rang in his mind. 
Tell Rowanstar I’m sorry it’s taking so 
long. Had StarClan known the journey 
would be this long when they’d sent 


Rowanstar’s words to  Spiresight? 
Would Tigerheart arrive too late to help 
his Clan? The tug of home grew stronger 
each day, and he realized that once more 
he was beginning to feel trapped, 
worrying more about ShadowClan with 
each passing sunset. 

As Tigerheart reached the camp now, 
he heard the kits squeaking. His 
whiskers twitched with pleasure as he 
glimpsed them over the bracken. 
Hollowkit and Spirekit were stalking 
Pouncekit and Lightkit while Sunkit 
nestled at Berryheart’s belly. Were they 
old enough to travel yet? 

“Watch out! Pouncekit mewed a 
warning to Lightkit as Spirekit sprang. 


Lightkit pretended to struggle to escape 
as the tiny kit began tugging at her tail. 
Hollowkit squealed with delight and 
flung himself at Pouncekit. He reared 
and hooked his claws into her shoulder, 
and she wailed dramatically and fell to 
the ground. 

“You got me!” Pouncekit groaned as 
he clambered onto her flank and stood 
there triumphantly. 

“Tigerheart!” Lightkit’s eyes lit up as 
she saw her father pad into camp. She 
pulled free of Spirekit and raced to meet 
him, sniffing eagerly at the prey he was 
carrying. “You caught a mouse!” She 
bounced around him. “Can I have it? I 
love mouse. It’s my favorite.” 


Tigerheart dropped the prey at the 
edge of the small clearing. “It’s 
Shadowkit’s favorite too,” he told her. 
“Yow ll have to share.” He glanced 
around the camp. Ant and Cinnamon 
were resting in a patch of sunshine that 
filtered between the branches. Rippletail 
was mending a hole in the bracken wall, 
threading brambles through, which 
Sparrowtail passed over the top. 
“Where is Shadowkit?” He couldn’t see 
the gray ton-kit. 

“He and Dovewing went out of camp 
to talk.” Lightkit was sniffing the mouse 
distractedly. 

Hollowkit and Spirekit hurried to 
sniff it with her. 


“Its all furry.” Spirekit frowned. 

Pouncekit padded to join them. “I 
like the fur,” she mewed. “It’s chewy.” 

As Hollowkit wrinkled his nose, 
Tigerheart peered over the top of the 
low camp wall. He could see Dovewing 
and Shadowkit a little way away, their 
heads bent together as they talked. He 
nodded to Lightkit. “Why don’t you 
show Spirekit how to strip out the 
meat?” he suggested. “But remember to 
leave some for Shadowkit.” 

“Okay.” She dragged the mouse 
away from the fresh-kill pile and began 
to nibble through the fur. Spirekit 
watched her eagerly. 

Tigerheart leaped the camp wall and 


padded toward Dovewing and 
Shadowkit. What were they talking about 
so intently? 

Dovewing looked up as he neared. 
She blinked as though she was relieved 
to see him. “You’re back.” There was 
worry in her mew. 

“Is everything okay?” Tigerheart 
glanced from Dovewing to Shadowkit. 
The gray tom’s eyes were round and 
anxious. 

“Shadowkit had a dream,” 
Dovewing told him. 

“A bad one?” Had the kit had a 
nightmare? 

“No.” Dovewing smoothed her tail 
along Shadowkit’s spine. “Tell 


Tigerheart what you told me.” 

“I know how to get to the lake,” 
Shadowkit mewed earnestly. 

Tigerheart frowned. “Really?” Had 
the kit been exploring? 

“I dreamed it,” Shadowkit 
explained. “I dreamed about the 
Twolegplace Spiresight said was at the 
end of the Thunderpath, and then I saw 
beyond. There was a valley with birch 
trees edging a small stretch of water and 
then a hill rising to moorland.” 

Moorland? Tigerheart stiffened. Was 
Shadowkit talking about WindClan 
territory? “Did you see beyond the 
moor?” He leaned closer to Shadowkit. 

“The moor stretched over a hilltop, 


then down to a lake.” 

Tigerheart’s throat tightened with 
excitement. Were they that close to 
home? “What did the lake look like?” 

“There was pine forest on one side, 
and oak forest, and near a marshy stretch 
of reeds at the far end, there was an 
island.” 

Tigerheart lifted his gaze to stare at 
Dovewing. “Our lake,” he breathed. “He 
saw our lake in a dream.” 

This one will see into the shadows. 
Tigerheart remembered  Spiresight 
staring at Shadowkit on the day he was 
born. This dream must be a vision. How 
else could Shadowkit describe the lake 
so exactly? Pelt prickling along his 


spine, he stared at Dovewing. “Have you 
ever described the lake to him?” 

“Not in that much detail,” she told 
him. “I said that there was forest beside 
it, but I don’t think I said what kind, and 
I didn’t mention the reed marshes or the 
island.” 

Tigerheart’s gaze flitted eagerly back 
to Shadowkit. “Do you think you could 
lead us there?” 

“I dreamed the whole route,” 
Shadowkit told him. “As though I were a 
hawk flying over it.” 

“But could you recognize it from the 
ground?” ‘Tigerheart pressed. Asking 
such a young cat to lead the patrol home 
was a big responsibility to place on 


small shoulders. He wanted to make sure 
Shadowkit could do it. “Could you tell 
us which paths to follow?” 

“Yes.” Shadowkit nodded eagerly. 
“That’s why I had the dream. I knew it 
while I was dreaming. It was to show 
you the way home.” 

Tigerheart’s belly tightened. 
Shadowkit’s bond with StarClan must be 
strong. He wondered whether it would 
last, or if their ancestors were just using 
the kit to guide their paws now. He 
blinked fondly at his son. “Thank you, 
Shadowkit. We’ll discuss what you’ve 
told us with the others.” 

Shadowkit’s pelt prickled uneasily. 
“We will go, won’t we?” 


“Of course,” Tigerheart promised. 
“We just need to decide when.” 

“Soon.” Urgency shone in 
Shadowkit’s eyes. 

“As soon as we can.” As Shadowkit 
searched his gaze, Tigerheart waved him 
away with a flick of his tail. He had to 
talk about it with Dovewing and then the 
other cats. “Lightkit’s stripping a mouse 
for Spirekit. She promised to save you 
some. Go and eat. You must be hungry.” 

Shadowkit gazed at him for another 
moment, then turned toward the camp. 
As he padded away, Tigerheart looked at 
Dovewing. “Do you think StarClan is 
really sharing dreams with him?” 

“I don’t see how else he could have 


described the lake so precisely.” 

“Tt seems too good to be true.” 

“You saw him,” Dovewing mewed. 
“How sincere he was. He believes his 
dream is true, and so do I. Perhaps he is 
connected to StarClan. Perhaps I 
dreamed I should travel to the city 
because I was carrying him in my belly.” 

Tigerheart shifted his paws. 
Spiresight had said that Shadowkit 
would be special. “Do you think he’ II be 
a medicine cat?” 

“Let’s worry about that when we get 
home.” Happiness suddenly sparked in 
Dovewing’s green gaze. “I never 
imagined we were so close.” 

Tigerheart could see over the camp 


wall from here. Spirekit had wandered 
away from Lightkit as she pulled the 
mouse apart and was watching his 
father’s tail twitch as Sparrowtail 
worked on the camp wall. Excitement 
sparked in the tiny kit’s gaze as the tail 
flashed back and forth in front of him. 
With a squeak, he pounced and fell onto 
his side. Wrapping his paws around the 
tail, he began churning it with his hind 
claws. Sparrowtail hardly seemed to 
notice. 

Tigerheart turned back to Dovewing. 
“Do you think Berryheart’s kits are 
ready to travel?” 

“Theyre still very small,” 
Dovewing murmured. “Even walking for 


two days would be hard on them. 
Especially in cold weather. They only 
have kit fur.” 

“Lets ask the others.” Tigerheart 
headed back to the camp, Dovewing at 
his heels. When he reached the small 
clearing, he lifted his chin. “I must speak 
with you.” He looked around the camp, 
meeting the gazes of Ant, Cinnamon, 
Cloverfoot, and Blaze as they turned to 
look. “Shadowkit has had a dream.” 

Rippletail left his work at the camp 
wall. 

Sparrowtail shook Spirekit from his 
tail and licked him between the ears. 
“Go and play with the other kits,” he 
mewed. 


99 


“You too.” Berryheart got to her 
paws, nudging Sunkit away. 

Dovewing nodded at Pouncekit. 
“Will you keep the young kits busy while 
we talk?” 

“Can’t we listen too?” Pouncekit 
asked as Sunkit, Hollowkit, and Spirekit 
hurried toward her. 

“You can listen,’ Dovewing 
meowed. “But you can’t interrupt.” 

As the kits clustered together, 
Berryheart padded closer. Ant and 
Cinnamon sat beside Cloverfoot and 
blinked at Tigerheart. 

“Shadowkit dreamed of the lake,” 
Tigerheart began. 

Rippletail pricked his ears. “Are you 


sure it was the lake?” 

“He described it exactly,” Tigerheart 
told him. “He saw the route we must 
take to get there and says he can lead us 
to it.” 

Shadowkit huddled closer to his 
sisters as the warriors turned to look at 
him. 

“Does he have visions like Spire?” 
Ant asked. 

“I guess he does.” Tigerheart felt a 
rush of pride. 

Cloverfoot tipped her head 
questioningly. “Do you really think a kit 
can lead us home?” 

“T think StarClan has chosen to share 
with us through him,”  Tigerheart 


meowed. “We need to know how to get 
home. Now we have been shown a way. 
It isn’t far. Only a day or two.” He 
looked at Berryheart. “Do you think your 
kits are ready to make the journey?” 
Hope rose in his chest as Berryheart’s 
gaze flicked toward her kits. J’m 
coming, ShadowClan. I'll be there 
soon. 

Berryheart shifted her paws uneasily. 
“Not yet,” she meowed. “They’re barely 
weaned.” 

Shadowkit stiffened, his pelt 
pricking. “But—” 

Tigerheart spoke over him. “The 
journey is not long.” His Clan was so 
near; and in need of his help. The tug of 


home felt like a thorn in his heart. “We 
can carry them most of the way.” 

“If you must go now, you can leave 
without us,” Berryheart offered. 

“No,” Tigerheart meowed firmly. 
“We leave together or not at all.” 

Dovewing blinked softly at 
Berryheart. “Will they be ready in a 
quarter moon?” 

Shadowkit flicked his tail. “We must 
leave before that!” 

Dovewing silenced him with a look. 
“I said no interrupting.” 

“But it was my dream—” 

Dovewing cut him off. “You are too 
young to be telling warriors what to do.” 

Shadowkit tucked his tail around his 


paws and stared at the ground. 

Dovewing turned back to Berryheart. 
“A quarter moon?” 

“Yes.” Berryheart gazed anxiously at 
her kits. “But only if the weather is 
fine.” 

Tigerheart flicked his tail eagerly. 
“Then it’s settled. In a quarter moon, 
we'll go home.” 


Dusk turned the thin clouds above 
the forest pink. A fresh wind stirred the 
branches. Tigerheart gazed at the moon 
as the sky darkened around it. The 
quarter moon had passed. They would 
leave at dawn. Anxiety fluttered in his 
belly. What would he find when he 
reached the lake? The shadows are 


fading. He can t keep them together. He 
couldn’t believe Rowanstar had let 
ShadowClan fall apart. They must be 
waiting for him. A forest without 
ShadowClan would be like a forest 
without trees. 

Dovewing gazed across the camp 
wall, scanning the woods. “The hunting 
patrol will be back soon,” she meowed. 
Cloverfoot and Sparrowtail had gone to 
find prey with Rippletail and Ant. 
Tigerheart had told them to catch as 
much as they could; he wanted the party 
to start their journey with full bellies. 

Blaze had left the camp with 
Cinnamon to hunt for herbs to give them 
strength. Berryheart was purring as she 


played moss-ball with  Spirekit. 
Hollowkit and Sunkit were exploring 
beyond the camp wall. Dovewing could 
see them now, sniffing at the roots of a 
beech while Pouncekit and Lightkit 
bounced around them, trying to catch the 
moths flitting around the bracken. 

“Why don’t you go and play with the 
other kits?” Tigerheart glanced at 
Shadowkit. The young tom was 
crouching in the shadow of the brambles, 
his eyes dark with worry. 

Shadowkit ignored his question. “We 
should leave tonight.” His gaze flashed 
toward the sky. “Tomorrow will be too 
late.” 

Tigerheart’s belly tightened. “Has 


StarClan shared something with you?” 

Shadowkit looked away. “I wish 
they had,” he murmured. “Then I could 
explain.” 

“Explain what?” 

“This feeling.” Shadowkit shifted his 
paws beneath him. “We shouldn’t be 
here.” 

“We leave in the morning,” 
Tigerheart soothed. Sharing a dream 
world with StarClan must be hard for a 
kit who was too young to understand 
even the real world. And yet he couldn’t 
resist probing. “In your vision,” he 
mewed softly, “have you seen a ginger 
tom?” 

Shadowkit glanced at him sharply. 


“No? Was I meant to?” 

“No.” Tigerheart shook out his pelt. 
He was putting too much pressure on the 
young tom. It wasn’t fair to ask him if 
StarClan had shared any news about 
Rowanstar. Shadowkit would have told 
me if he knew anything. Why would 
there be news of his father? Rowanstar 
had probably solved ShadowClan’s 
problems by now. 

“Tigerheart!” Dovewing’s mew was 
taut. He looked at her. She was still 
watching the kits. Had she spotted the 
hunting patrol? 

“What is it?” He followed her gaze 
as she raised her eyes to the canopy. 

A dark shadow flitted between the 


branches. Tigerheart’s pelt spiked with 
alarm. 

Owl. 

It was gliding silently above the kits. 
His heart lurched as he saw it swoop. 
With a gasp, he leaped the camp wall 
and pelted toward Pouncekit. “Hide!” 
Lightkit and Pouncekit scattered into the 
bracken. Sunkit stared at him, her eyes 
wide. Hollowkit seemed rooted to the 
spot. Tigerheart looked up as he felt the 
wind from the owl’s wings. The owl 
was so huge it blocked out the sky. Pelt 
bushing, he saw its talons reach for 
Hollowkit. He lunged forward and 
pushed the kit clear, then reared to beat 
away the owl. 


Gray fur flashed at the corner of his 
eye. Dovewing leaped for the owl, her 
claws outstretched. With a screech, she 
tore at its wing as it began to lift. 
Tigerheart glimpsed its beady eye. It 
flapped its giant wing, knocking 
Dovewing away. Tigerheart slashed at 
its chest, blinded by a flurry of feathers. 
Then pain pierced his flanks. Talons 
clutched him as hard as stone. Shock 
pulsed in his chest as he felt himself 
lifted. The owl had caught him. He 
thrashed helplessly in its grip as the 
earth fell away from his paws. Wind 
rushed around him as the owl rose 
among the trees and glided between the 
branches. A moment later the trees were 


below him. Tigerheart struggled for 
breath as air rushed around him. Dizzy 
with terror, he stared as the ground 
disappeared into shadow. 

Dovewing and Berryheart were 
screeching. Their cries echoed far 
below. The kits mewled in terror. Panic 
shrilled beneath his pelt. Numb with 
fear, Tigerheart twisted between the 
owl’s talons and swung his paws 
around. Claws stretched out, he sliced at 
the owl’s belly. The owl screeched in 
pain and loosened its grip. 

Tigerheart felt himself slipping from 
its talons. His heart leaped to his throat. 
Wind battered his pelt as he fell, his 
thoughts reeling. He flailed, grasping at 


nothing. Then branches whipped his face 
and battered his flanks as he dropped 
through the canopy. He saw tree trunks 
blur around him, and then he hit the 
ground. 

The thump of earth against his chest 
knocked the breath from him. 

Then everything went dark. 





CHAPTER 34 
Cog 


Blazing pain dragged Tigerheart into 
consciousness. Agony seared in his 
chest and seemed to reach through his 
body to the tip of each hair on his pelt. 
He wanted to hide in sleep, but pain 
forced him awake. Reluctantly, he 
opened his eyes. He was lying on his 
side, paws stretched in front of him. 
Around him, night had swallowed the 
forest. 

“Tigerheart.” Relief throbbed in 
Dovewing’s mew. He felt her muzzle 
sink into his neck fur, and he groaned at 
the weight of it. She jerked away. “Can 


you move?” 

Fighting pain, Tigerheart rolled onto 
his paws and forced himself up. The 
world spun as he fought for breath. Stone 
seemed to grip his chest, while rats 
gnawed inside his belly. He collapsed. 

“Are his legs broken?” Rippletail 
thrust his muzzle close. He sounded 
scared. 

“Let me see.” Cinnamon ducked 
closer and began to run her trembling 
paws over his pelt. 

Their voices sounded distant. 
Through the fog of pain, Tigerheart 
became aware of cats around him. 
Cloverfoot, Rippletail, and Sparrowtail 
clustered beside Ant and Blaze. 


Hollowkit, Sunkit, and Spirekit hid 
behind Berryheart. The queen stared at 
Tigerheart, rigid with shock. Lightkit, 
Pouncekit, and Shadowkit stood beside 
Dovewing, fear glittering in their eyes. 

Cinnamon sat back on her haunches. 
“I can’t feel any broken bones.” She 
lowered her voice so that Tigerheart had 
to strain to hear. “But there’s swelling in 
his belly.” 

“What does that mean?” Dovewing 
whispered in panic. 

“Something is broken inside.” 
Cinnamon’s gaze darkened. 

“Can you do anything?” Dovewing 
was trembling. 

“I can give him thyme for the shock,” 


Cinnamon murmured. 

Dovewing stared at her. “Didn’t you 
learn anything else while you were with 
the guardian cats?” 

Cinnamon stared back helplessly. 
Dovewing’s eyes flashed with 
frustration. She turned to Blaze. “What 
about you? You worked with Spiresight. 
Did he teach you anything?” 

Blaze blinked at her nervously. ““We 
never had to treat injuries like this.” 

Cloverfoot caught Tigerheart’s eye. 
“He’s probably just badly shaken. Let 
him rest.” 

He heard the lie in her mew. I’m 
going to die. He tried to focus on 
Dovewing, fear flickering beyond the 


pain. Don * let the kits see. 

Dovewing nudged Shadowkit 
forward. “Can you treat him?” She 
stared desperately at the young tom. 
“You share dreams with StarClan. They 
can tell you what to do.” 

Shadowkit blinked at her, then 
looked in panic at Tigerheart. “I don’t 
know,” he whimpered. 

Cinnamon eyed Dovewing sternly 
and wrapped her tail around Shadowkit. 
“How could a kit so young know how to 
fix him?” 

Dovewing’s eyes misted with grief. 
“Someone has to help him!” She looked 
at the stars. “This can’t be happening.” 

Tigerheart struggled to speak. So 


little breath! Z’m sorry. For a moment, 
grief clouded the pain that scorched from 
his belly to his chest. He was breaking 
Dovewing’s heart. And the kits’. They 
watched, their eyes round with fear. He 
tried to meet their gaze. 

“You saved Hollowkit.” 
Berryheart’s breath bathed his muzzle. 
She was leaning close. “How can I ever 
thank you?” 

For a moment, the memory flashed in 
Tigerheart’s mind. MHollowkit had 
weighed so little when he’d pushed him 
clear of the owl’s talons. Terror flooded 
him as he remembered the claws curling 
around his flanks and the ground falling 
away. He closed his eyes, trying to block 


out the thoughts, wishing he could block 
out the pain, seeking the refuge of sleep. 

“No!” Paws shook him. Dovewing 
was glaring into his eyes. “You mustn’t 
sleep!” Determination hardened her 
gaze. Grief was gone. Her green eyes 
were clear with purpose. “We’re going 
to get you to a medicine cat.” 

“How?” Rippletail gasped in shock. 

Dovewing ignored the tabby tom. 
She was glaring at Shadowkit. “How far 
is it to the lake?” 

“I d-don’t know.” Shadowkit 
flinched from her. “There’s the 
Twolegplace and the water and the 
moor.” 

“Tigerheart said no more than two 


days’ walk,” Cloverfoot reminded her. 

Dovewing was still glaring at 
Shadowkit. “Is that what it looked like in 
your dream?” she snapped. 

Pouncekit darted to her brother’s 
side. “Don’t scare him.” She stared 
defiantly at her mother. “He’ll help if he 
can.” 

Dovewing shifted her paws, taking a 
deep, slow breath. “You’re right. I’m 
sorry, Shadowkit.” 

Tigerheart could hear that she was 
forcing herself to be calm. She blurred 
in front of him. The frozen forest seemed 
to whisper around him. He could smell 
frost and imagined it creeping across the 
grass toward him. He pictured it stealing 


over his body and drawing the last drop 
of warmth from his pelt. Tiredness 
pulled him deeper into the earth. 

“Stay awake, Tigerheart.” 
Dovewing’s muzzle was beside his. Her 
voice was soft. “We’re going to save 
you. I can’t lose you. Not after all we’ve 
been through. There’s so much left for us 
to do together. Our future is beside the 
lake. We always knew that. I won’t let 
that future be snatched away from us 
now.” Her gaze fixed on his. “Do you 
want to live?” 

“Yes.” He shuddered as he breathed. 

“Then you have to get to your paws.” 
She straightened and swished her tail. 
“We have to leave now. We’re going to 


the lake.” 

“He can’t walk that far!” 
Sparrowtail’s eyes widened. 

Cloverfoot stepped forward. “He 
can if we help him.” 

“Its his only chance.” Dovewing 
looked around the cats, her eyes 
glittering as though half pleading, half 
demanding. Tigerheart felt a rush of love 
for her and pushed himself to his paws. 
He swallowed back the agonized wail 
that wanted to escape from his throat. He 
wasn’t going to let his kits know how 
much he hurt. 

Rippletail leaned against one flank. 
Sparrowtail pressed against the other. 
Together they lifted him so that his paws 


99 


barely skimmed the grass as they began 
to walk forward. Blind with pain as they 
moved him, he tried to focus. Trapped in 
a tunnel of agony, he kept his gaze ahead. 
The tunnel would end with the lake. He 
had to make it. 

He lost sense of time. Earth passing 
beneath his paws. Flashes of starlight. 
Staggering pain. The brush of fresh pelts 
against his flanks as the other cats took 
turns to support him. And then dawn. 
Light seeped across the land. He half 
expected the rising sun to lift the white- 
hot agony from his limbs. But the pain 
stayed, obscuring his thoughts, blocking 
his gaze. 

How long could he bear it? 


Sometimes he closed his eyes and let his 
campmates carry him, but each time, 
Dovewing thrust her muzzle against his 
and hissed, “You can’t sleep, Tigerheart. 
Wake up!” 

There was such power in her mew. 
He fed off it like a starving kit, sucking 
strength from her, holding it deep inside. 
For a few wonderful moments, it even 
blocked the pain. 

And then he could smell water. “The 
lake?” He grunted as his campmates 
lowered him gently to the ground. He 
gazed across the grass. Birch trees lined 
a small stretch of water. Hope flickered 
in his chest. 

“We’re not there yet.” Dovewing 


was beside him. “But look.” She lifted 
his chin toward the horizon. A hill rose 
from the valley, and he recognized 
WindClan’s moor, bending its back 
toward the sky like the spine of a cat. 
Through the stabbing in his chest, he felt 
joy flood his heart. “Home,” he 
whispered. 

He felt Dovewing’s cheek warm 
against his. “Home,” she breathed. 

“Why have we stopped?” Tigerheart 
tried to make out the others. They were 
padding away, into the long grass that 
surrounded the water. 

“They’ve gone to hunt,” Dovewing 
told him. “We need to eat.” 

“The kits?” He looked around, 


searching for Pouncekit, Lightkit, and 
Shadowkit. They were crouching in the 
grass a few tail-lengths away. “Come 
here,” he called hoarsely. 

They looked up and stared at him 
with wide, frightened eyes. 

“Its all right.” Dovewing reassured 
them softly. “You can come near.” 

Tigerheart saw reluctance in their 
movements as they padded toward him. 
“There’s nothing to be scared of.” 

“Are you dying?” Pouncekit asked 
tremulously as she reached him. 

He reached a paw out to touch hers. 
“I can’t die now.” He fought for air. 
“Home is so near.” 

“You'll get well, wont you?” 


Lightkit’s eyes misted with fear. 

Shadowkit pressed against his flank. 
“You promised to show us the pine 
forest.” 

“I still will,” Tigerheart promised, 
focusing through a fresh wave of pain. 

Berryheart hovered nearby, her kits 
clustering around her. “I can try to find 
some poppy seeds,” she meowed 
hopefully. “They'll be hard to find in 
leafbare, but they’d help his pain.” 

“No,” Dovewing meowed sharply. 
“Poppy seeds would make him sleep. He 
mustn’t sleep.” 

As she spoke, Blaze bounded toward 
her, a mouse dangling from his jaws. He 
dropped it in front of her. “For 


Tigerheart,’ he meowed. “To give him 
strength.” He headed back into the long 
grass. 

Dovewing settled beside Tigerheart 
and began carefully to strip flesh from 
the mouse’s carcass. 

Tigerheart smelled the warm scent of 
fresh-kill. “Share it with the kits,” he 
murmured. “They like mouse.” 

Dovewing was chewing a lump of 
meat. She took it from between her teeth 
with her paw and pressed it to 
Tigerheart’s mouth as though he were a 
kit. “Eat it,” she ordered. 

He took the morsel and let it sit on 
his tongue. He closed his eyes as he 
struggled to swallow. Pain seared his 


flanks at the effort. He turned his face 
away as Dovewing tried to give him 
more. “Give it to the kits.” 

Exhausted, he closed his eyes. 

“Don’t sleep!” Dovewing pulled his 
muzzle toward her. She searched his 
gaze desperately, as though reaching for 
something she could not see. “Remember 
before the cats of the Dark Forest came, 
when we used to meet on the 
ShadowClan border?” 

He struggled to recall the memory as 
she went on. 

“You were so cocky and sure of 
yourself.” She purred. 

“You were such a goody-four- 
paws,” he teased, his words hardly more 


than a breath. 

“And the time in the Dark Forest 
when...” 

Her mew faded as he drifted into 
dream. Darkness swirled around him. 
Stars sparkled, and he opened his eyes 
and saw sunlit meadows, lush with the 
richness of greenleaf. His paws pressed 
into soft grass. Pain faded, distant now, 
as though pushed beyond the bright green 
horizon. 

A tom padded over the rolling slope, 
his orange pelt like flame against the 
grass. 

Tigerheart recognized him at once. 
His heart leaped. “Rowanstar!” His 
father looked so sleek and strong. He 


was once more the noble warrior 
Tigerheart remembered from his kithood. 
He hurried to meet him. “Is ShadowClan 
safe?” 

Rowanstar stopped and met his gaze, 
his green eyes flashing “I’m 
Rowanclaw now.” 

Tigerheart frowned, confused. 
“Why?” How could a Clan leader lose 
his name? 

“I forgive you for leaving.” 
Rowanclaw’s gaze fixed unwaveringly 
on Tigerheart. 

Shame flashed hot beneath 
Tigerheart’s pelt. J left my Clan. He’d 
forgotten. The pain of the fall had blotted 
out memory. “I had to,” he blurted. “I 


was blocking the sun. I needed to give 
you space to make the shadows strong 
again.” 

“There’s no need to explain.” 
Rowanclaw’s gaze was gentle now. No 
recrimination flickered there. “Now that 
I’m with StarClan, I understand. I see it 
all, and everything makes sense.” 

Tigerheart’s thoughts jumbled. 
“Youre... dead?” He felt sunshine on 
his pelt. A warm breeze tugged at his fur. 
“Js this StarClan?” Grief swamped 
Tigerheart, but he wasn’t sure whether it 
was pain at the loss of his father or at 
being here, separated from Dovewing 
and his kits. “Am I dead too?” 

The ground shifted beneath him. Like 


night rushing in, darkness swallowed the 
green fields, and Tigerheart found 
himself engulfed by water. It pulled him 
down into depths that pressed against his 
pelt and filled his ears and nose. He 
twisted, trying to haul himself to the 
surface. Orange fur moved beside him. 
Rowanstar? 

No. The face that floated before him 
in the cloudy water belonged to 
Flametail. His brother’s eyes were wild 
with panic. Bubbles drifted from his 
mouth and nose as he thrashed in 
desperation, falling ever deeper into the 
murky gloom. 

Tigerheart’s lungs burned. As panic 
lit every hair on fire, he opened his eyes. 


He was beside the pond once more. 
Darkness was creeping across the grass, 
swallowing the meadows around him. 
Gulping for air, he tried to draw in a 
shuddering breath. Pain clamped his 
chest. “I can’t breathe,” he gasped. 

Dovewing crouched beside him, fear 
sharpening her green gaze. Ant and 
Cinnamon stared in horror. Cloverfoot, 
Rippletail, and Sparrowtail watched 
with dark, round eyes while Berryheart 
tried to shield her kits. 

“ShadowClan.”  Tigerheart felt 
darkness pressing at the edges of his 
thoughts. Rowanstar was dead. So much 
was left undone. “ShadowClan must 
survive.” He stared desperately at 


Rippletail. “You have to save it.” 

Dovewing trembled, pressing her 
flank against his. “Don’t die,” she 
whimpered. “Please don’t die.” 

Shadowkit buried his nose in 
Tigerheart’s fur. Pouncekit and Lightkit 
clung to his neck. 

“Take the kits to ThunderClan.” 
Tigerheart breathed the words and could 
not draw in air for more. J always loved 
you. Peace flooded him. Pain melted. 
Dovewing. He regretted nothing except 
that he would never see his kits grow 
into warriors. PIL watch them from 
StarClan. Like a warrior releasing prey, 
he let go his grip and allowed darkness 
to swallow him. 





CHAPTER 35 
Cog 


Tigerheart shifted on his side. He felt 
the familiar crunch of pine needles 
beneath his flank. The scent of sap filled 
his nose, and he was suddenly aware 
that he felt no pain. Relief flooded him. 
He opened his eyes. Pines stretched 
around him. Fresh brambles sprawled 
around their trunks. Ferns, green and 
bright, sprouted where the sun reached 
through the dark branches. I’m home. 
And yet the forest was warm. The 
biting chill of leaf-bare had lifted. Prey- 
scent hung in the warm air. Confused, 
Tigerheart clambered to his paws. He’d 


closed his eyes in cold and pain. 

His heart lurched as he understood. 
This is StarClan. He was dead. Before 
had been a dream, but this was real. He 
spun, scanning the trees. Dovewing! 
Pouncekit, Lightkit, and Shadowkit! 
Grief hollowed his heart. This wasn’t 
supposed to happen. He’d promised to 
take them home. 

He ran, skimming the forest floor, 
racing for sunlight filtering in at the edge 
of the forest. He reached it, blinking 
against the brightness as he broke from 
the trees. In meadows stretching ahead, 
he saw cats moving over the grass. Panic 
spiraled in his thoughts. Take me back! 

He forced his breathing to slow. 


Drawing in deep breaths, he stopped 
himself trembling. This was the will of 
StarClan. He must accept it. He 
remembered the agony of his final 
moments. Did he really want to go back 
to that? 

“Tigerheart?” A surprised mew 
sounded behind him. 

He glanced over his shoulder and 
saw, with a rush of delight, Spiresight 
padding from the ferns. “You made it to 
StarClan!” He hurried to greet the black 
tom, touching his nose to his cheek. “The 
warrior ceremony worked.” 

“Yes.” Spiresight stopped in front of 
him. “Thank you.” 

“Where are the others?” Tigerheart 


peered past the healer, scanning the 
forest behind him for more Clanmates. 
Euphoria suddenly welled in his chest. 
Why had he been so scared? He would 
be among old friends here. Dovewing 
would join him one day, and there would 
be no pain to endure, no cold to shiver 
through, no hunger, no responsibility. 
Here there was no need for leaders or 
warriors or medicine cats. There would 
be peace. “Where’s Rowanstar—I mean 
Rowanclaw—and Flametail? They’re 
here, right?” 

Spiresight’s gaze was troubled. “You 
mustn’t meet them.” 

Tigerheart blinked at him. ““Why?” 

“You shouldn’t be here.” 





“But I died.” 

“Look.” Spiresight brushed his paw 
through the pine needles coating the 
forest floor. As they stirred, Tigerheart 
saw an image shimmering below him. 

He could see WindClan’s moor, 
crouched like a black cat against the 
stone cold of leaf-bare. And beyond it, 
the lake sparked beneath a chilly sun. 
This must be how birds see the land. 
“Why are you showing me this?” 

“Look closely.” Spiresight gazed at 
the image. 

Tigerheart peered harder and 
glimpsed pelts moving across the moor, 
trailing like ants through the faded 
heather. As he focused, the image grew 


and sharpened, closer now. He 
recognized the pelts. Dovewing! She 
staggered beside Ant while Rippletail 
and Sparrowtail flanked them. A shape 
was draped across their backs. With a 
jolt, Tigerheart recognized his own pelt. 
“They’re carrying my body!” 

Behind the patrol, Berryheart carried 
her kits on her back, huddled deep into 
her fur. Pouncekit, Lightkit, and 
Shadowkit trailed behind, hollow-eyed, 
while Cinnamon and Cloverfoot 
shielded them against the biting wind. 

Pouncekit stared after Dovewing, her 
gaze fixed on the body across her 
mother’s back. Tigerheart’s chest 
tightened as he saw pain in the kit’s 


gaze. She’d never looked sad before. 
Shadowkit stared at his paws. Lightkit’s 
eyes were misted with grief. No cat 
spoke as they trudged slowly toward the 
lake. 

Tigerheart blinked at Spiresight. 
“Why are they carrying me home?” It 
made no sense to make their journey 
harder. “They should have buried me 
where I died.” 

Spiresight gazed back unwavering. 
“They are not as willing to let go of you 
as you are to let go of them.” 

“That’s not true!” Tigerheart bridled. 
“I had no choice.” 

Spiresight blinked at him. “You have 
a choice now. It’s not your time yet, 


Tigerheart.” 

“But my body is broken. I can’t go 
back. It hurt so much. Don’t make me go 
back.” Fear sparked beneath his pelt. He 
couldn’t face more pain. 

“What about your kits?” 

Tigerheart looked down at 
Pouncekit, Lightkit, and Shadowkit once 
more. Their shoulders sagged with 
sorrow only a grown cat should know. 
Grief crushed his heart. “Dovewing is 
strong,” he told Spiresight. “She’s a 
great mother. She can raise them in 
ThunderClan, and they will never feel 
the pull between Clans that we did.” 

Spiresight stared back bleakly. 
“Without ShadowClan, there can be no 


ThunderClan, no  WindClan, no 
RiverClan, no SkyClan. Five Clans or 
none. ShadowClan needs you, 
Tigerheart. It’s not your time to die. You 
have to go back.” 

Tigerheart stared at the healer, his 
thoughts whirling. Below there was pain 
and struggle and _ responsibility. 
Everything that had weighed his paws 
while he was alive still waited for him. 
But so did Dovewing and their kits. Was 
a life with them worth the hardship of 
living? Tigerheart pushed away the 
beguiling murmur that whispered of the 
prey-rich forest behind him and the sun- 
drenched meadows ahead. Comfort was 
for kits. Pouncekit, Lightkit, and 


Shadowkit deserved to be safe, warm, 
and well fed. J am a warrior. It is my 
duty to suffer for them. He dipped his 
head. “You're right,” he breathed. “It is 
not my time. I want to go back.” 

As he spoke, the forest shifted and 
blurred. Shadows engulfed him, lifting 
him up until he was spinning among the 
stars. He closed his eyes, bracing 
himself for pain and cold, and drifted 
down onto chilly stone. 

He opened his eyes. The exposed 
rock beneath his paws stretched toward 
a night sky on every side. He blinked in 
surprise as he saw starry cats moving 
around him. “StarClan?” Their pelts 
glittered like fire and ice, and they 


carried the scent of the seasons, stone- 
cold snow mingled with sweet blossom, 
leaf musk tinged with sharp sap tang. 

“Tigerheart.” Rowanclaw stepped 
forward. 

Countless eyes reflected starlight, 
watching as Rowanclaw padded toward 
Tigerheart. 

“My son.” He stopped in front of 
Tigerheart and gazed with eyes 
brimming with love. “We knew this day 
would come.” 

Tigerheart frowned, puzzled. “You 
knew I was going to die?” 

Rowanclaw tipped his head, 
blinking gently. “Do you know what 
happens now?” 


Tigerheart shifted his paws, self- 
conscious under the gaze of so many 
cats. “I’m... I’m being sent back. But 
how?” 

“There is only one way a cat may 
receive another life.” Rowanclaw 
paused as Tigerheart struggled to 
understand. 

A leadership ceremony! His pelt 
prickled with anxiety. “I’m not ready!” 
he blurted. “Pm not strong enough to 
lead a Clan.” 

“Really?” Rowanclaw gazed deep 
into Tigerheart’s eyes. Memories shifted 
as though woken by his father’s gaze. 
He’d persuaded  Scorchfur and 
Juniperclaw to stay with ShadowClan. 


He’d journeyed to the city to find 
Dovewing and his kits. He’d helped the 
guardian cats learn how to defend what 
was theirs. And he’d led his family and 
his friends home. Rowanclaw_ broke 
their gaze with a blink. “You will never 
be more ready than you are now.” He 
leaned forward and touched his nose to 
Tigerheart’s head. 

Fierce heat seared through 
Tigerheart’s pelt. Flame seemed to burn 
away his fur like grass in a prairie fire, 
but he could not flee. His paws were 
weighted like stones. 

“With this life I give you strength. 
Don’t let softness sway you from what 
must be done for your Clan.” 


Rowanclaw broke away, and the fire 
subsided, leaving determination burning 
in Tigerheart’s belly. 

He opened his eyes, trembling. 
StarClan watched in stillness, and 
Tigerheart began to recognize some of 
their faces. Pinenose, Kinkfur, Flametail. 
His brother looked so young and strong, 
his broad shoulders squared as he gazed 
proudly at Tigerheart. 

As Rowanclaw turned away, Kinkfur 
padded forward. 

The ShadowClan elder looked sleek 
and young. He hardly recognized her. 
Only the knowing flash in her eyes 
betrayed her long life. She pressed her 
nose to his head. “With this life I give 


you courage. Fear will always pull at 
your tail, but the courage I give you now 
will always draw you on.” 

His body was seized by a hard, 
fierce agony that stiffened his muscles 
and left him shaking with shock. 

Pinenose was beside him now, 
touching her nose to his head. “With this 
life I give you compassion. Love your 
Clan as you love your kits. Forgive them 
their flaws and love them even when 
they fail you.” 

Warmth flooded his heart and 
reached deep into his belly. It snatched 
his breath with its intensity, and as 
Pinenose pulled away, he met her gaze 
and saw the deep affection he’d seen in 


Dovewing’s eyes on the night Pouncekit, 
Lightkit, and Shadowkit were born. He 
returned her gaze, hoping she could read 
the promise in his. J will. 

Another cat padded from the ranks of 
starry cats, a familiar face he hadn’t 
spotted yet. A familiar face he had hoped 
to one day see again—just not in 
StarClan 

Dawnpelt! His sister’s eyes shone 
like stars. Tigerheart wanted to greet her, 
but he couldn’t move or speak. You 
really are dead. He’d suspected, but 
hadn’t been sure until now. Joy and grief 
seemed to fight within his heart as she 
touched her nose to his head. “With this 
life I give you hope. As long as hope 


burns in your heart, it will burn in the 
hearts of your Clanmates.” 

Energy fired through Tigerheart. In 
his mind he was running, skimming the 
earth, pines blurring beside him. His 
heart beat so fast that the breath caught in 
his throat. As his body shivered in 
spasm, Dawnpelt padded away, and a 
ragged she-cat took her place. 

“I am  “Yellowfang, once of 
ShadowClan.” 

Tigerheart stared at her, breathless. 
He’d heard nursery tales of this cat. 
Exiled by her Clan, betrayed by her son, 
she’d found sanctuary with ThunderClan 
before she died. What blessing could she 
give him? 


She leaned close, her breath meaty, 
and touched her nose to his head. “With 
this life, I give you forgiveness.” Ice 
seemed to grip Tigerheart’s body, 
freezing him rigid until he could hardly 
breathe. Pain streaked through him, like 
stone cracking. And then suddenly it 
eased, and warmth bathed him once 
more as  Yellowfang went on. 
“Forgiveness will give you more power 
than vengeance will ever bring.” 

As Yellowfang stepped away, a 
snowy white she-cat padded from the 
ranks of star-pelted warriors. She 
nodded to Yellowfang before looking at 
Tigerheart. “I am Sagewhisker.” Her 
blue eyes sparkled as she leaned close 


and touched her nose to his head. “With 
this life, I give you persistence.” A bolt 
of energy, as fierce as lightning, seared 
through Tigerheart. He stiffened against 
the pain, but it melted into a soft warmth 
through which he could feel the strong 
steady beat of his heart. “Don’t let 
failure sap your determination or 
rejection change your mind. A true 
leader tries as many times as it takes to 
succeed.” 

“Tigerheart.” Littlecloud’s mew took 
Tigerheart by surprise. His heart 
swelled with joy at seeing the old 
medicine cat. The familiarity in his 
bright eyes warmed him. For a moment 
he remembered what it was like to live 


in a Clan that was united and strong. 
“Fear of failure has kept you too long 
from leadership. But leadership is your 
destiny, and one that you must embrace if 
you are to save your Clan. So with this 
life I give you acceptance. Accept with 
all your heart what you cannot change, 
and fear will vanish.” As he touched his 
nose to Tigerheart’s head, Tigerheart felt 
engulfed by peace. The worry that 
seemed to have pressed on him for 
moons melted like snow in sunshine. So 
what if he failed to save his Clan? The 
only failure was not to try. And all that 
truly mattered was that, for a while, they 
had felt cool forest shade on their pelts. 
A dark tabby tom stepped into 


Littlecloud’s place. His pelt was patchy, 
and there were scars on his nose. “I, 
Raggedstar, give you this life for 
loyalty.” As the tom’s nose touched his 
head, Tigerheart was suddenly aware of 
the depth of rock beneath his paws. His 
pads drew in its burning chill until ice 
seemed to freeze his bones. He twitched 
as Raggedstar went on. “A leader’s 
loyalty belongs only to his Clan. Let 
loyalty be your heartbeat, for when it 
stops, so will you.” 

Loyalty? Tigerheart’s throat 
tightened. What about Dovewing? She 
was ThunderClan. What about his kits? 
Did leadership mean that he would be 
separated from them? Before he could 


think any more, Flametail stepped 
forward. 

“I wish I could still walk at your 
side,” Flametail whispered. “I wish I 
could help you reunite our Clan.” 
Tigerheart felt his brother’s breath stir 
his fur as he touched his head and went 
on. “With this life I give you love. You 
have known so much, but still have much 
to give. Leadership without love will 
never be enough to draw your Clan from 
the shadows. Let your heart lead when 
your head does not know the way.” 
Tenderness surged in Tigerheart’s chest, 
strong and yet fragile, and so fierce that 
he thought his heart would shatter. He 
closed his eyes and let the sensation 


overwhelm him As he did, grief 
unfurled inside him. To have found so 
much and lost so much felt more than he 
could bear. 

Nine lives. The thought burned in his 
mind as Flametail pulled away. 
Tigerheart staggered, limp from the 
intensity of his Clanmates’ gifts. He 
gazed around at the cats he’d known and 
cats he’d only know once his lives had 
been used up. 

Rowanclaw padded forward once 
more. He stared gravely at Tigerheart. 
“This has never been done before. You 
have already used up one life, but there 
are eight remaining. Use them as you 
used the first—with courage and for the 


good of others.” 

Raggedstar whisked his tail. 
“Reunite ShadowClan.” 

“There must always be five Clans,” 
Dawnpelt meowed. “Where there is sky, 
thunder, wind, and river, there must also 
be shadow.” 

Flametail fixed him with his starlit 
gaze. “You are the only one who can 
bring ShadowClan back.” 

Bring it back? Tigerheart stared at 
him. “Where has ShadowClan gone?” 

No cat answered. Instead they lifted 
their muzzles to the crow-black sky. 
“Tigerstar! Tigerstar!” The cold might 
rang with the voices of StarClan as they 
chanted his new name. The stars in their 


pelts shimmered and began to shift 
before his eyes. The cats lost their shape 
and merged into a great swath of stars. 
They swirled upward, like leaves caught 
in a sudden wind and scattered across 
the wide black sky. 

Bring it back? Tigerstar’s legs 
buckled beneath him. As he collapsed 
onto the cold stone, he saw what must be 
the Moonpool shining beside him. 

Puddleshine stood next to him, his 
eyes lighting with joy as Tigerstar 
looked up at it him. “It worked!” 

Tigerstar hesitated, expecting to feel 
pain. But his body felt stronger than 
ever. He scrambled to his paws and 
stared at the medicine cat. “How did I 


get here?” 

Puddleshine nodded toward the lip 
of the hollow. “Rippletail, Cloverfoot, 
and the others carried you home. They’re 
waiting for you now.” 

Tigerstar’s belly tightened. “Are 
Dovewing and the kits with them?” Had 
she taken them to ThunderClan as he’d 
told her? 

“Every cat is waiting for you.” 
Puddleshine blinked at him, moonlight 
shimmering in his eyes. 

The medicine cat led him along a 
smooth path that spiraled away from the 
Moonpool, up to the stone ledge, where 
the encircling cliffs opened to the 
glittering might sky. Tigerstar blinked at 


the stars as he padded over stone 
dimpled by the paw steps of cats over 
countless moons. Was StarClan watching 
his first moments as leader of 
ShadowClan? Rowanclaw! Spiresight! 
He paused, gazing at the sky. Are you 
there? 

“Hurry!” Puddleshine was already 
waiting at the top of the hollow. 
“They’re anxious to see you.” He looked 
over the edge as Tigerstar reached him. 

Tigerstar followed his gaze. A steep 
jumble of rocks plunged toward a stream 
below. At the edge of the starlit water, 
which wound away between moor and 
forest like a glittering snail track, cats 
were crowding, their faces lifted toward 


the hollow. 

Their wide eyes glittered with 
wonder as they saw him. 

Tigerstar spotted Ant and Cinnamon 
at the front. Blaze, Ruippletail, and 
Cloverfoot clustered beside them with 
Berryheart, Sparrowtail and their kits, 
while the rest of ShadowClan gathered 
behind. His chest seemed to burst with 
joy at the sight of so many familiar faces. 
Scrambling past Puddleshine, he half 
leaped, half slithered down the rocks 
and landed lightly on the rough grass 
beside Ant. 

He scanned the crowd, his breath 
catching in his throat. There was one 
face he wanted to see above all. 


“Dovewing!” 

She pushed between Rippletail and 
Cloverfoot. “You’re alive!” Her words 
were little more than a gasp, as though 
she hardly believed them. 

Tigerstar wanted to press his cheek 
against hers and feel the warmth of her 
fur, but Cloverfoot wove excitedly 
between them. “It was Puddleshine’s 
idea to bring you to the Moonpool and 
let your nose touch the water so you 
could share dreams with StarClan.” 

“But I was dead.” Tigerstar stared at 
them, gratitude swelling in his chest. He 
could feel the eyes of his Clanmates on 
him. Was he supposed to address them? 
What should he say? As he blinked at 


them, overwhelmed, Shadowkit padded 
from behind Dovewing. Pouncekit and 
Lightkit followed, their eyes as wide as 
moons. 

Tigerstar rushed to meet them, 
pressing his nose to each one in turn, 
purring loudly. As Pouncekit and Lightkit 
crowded around him, Shadowkit touched 
his nose. “Spiresight says this is right.” 

Tigerstar lapped the tom-kit fiercely 
between the ears. “I saw him,” he 
mewed. “He’s with StarClan.” 

Shadowkit broke into a purr. 

Tigerstar felt fur brush his side. 
Dovewing’s scent billowed around him. 
Joy flared in his heart. He pressed his 
cheek against hers. “You’ve been so 


brave and strong.” 

“No more than you,” she murmured. 

A leader s loyalty belongs only to 
his Clan. Raggedstar’s words suddenly 
rang in his mind. 7 must choose my Clan 
over Dovewing and the kits. He pulled 
away and stared at her, grief stabbing his 
heart. “Will you go to ThunderClan 
now?” 

Dovewing gazed at him wonderingly. 
“Why?” 

“Your head told you to raise our kits 
among your Clan, remember?” 

“But my heart told me to stay with 
you.” Her gaze clouded with love. “How 
could I leave, after all we’ve been 
through?” She glanced at the kits, who 


were weaving happily around them. 
“And how could I deprive our kits of 
such a wonderful father?” Purring, she 
thrust her muzzle against his. 

Tigerstar closed his eyes and 
relished her warmth. Paws scuffed the 
grass around him. He pulled away and 
saw his Clanmates staring. There was 
uncertainty in their gazes. 

Tawnypelt stepped forward. She 
flicked her tail toward Cinnamon, Ant, 
and Blaze. “You’ve brought back new 
warriors as well as old.” 

Tigerstar tried to read her gaze. Was 
she angry with him? 

Tawnypelt looked at Dovewing and 
the kits. “And it seems we’re getting 


ThunderClan cats too.” 

He hesitated, conscious of the unease 
rippling through the pelts of his 
Clanmates. Then he remembered his 
leadership ceremony. Strength, courage, 
compassion, hope, forgiveness, 
persistence, acceptance, loyalty, and 
love. These were gifts he carried with 
him now. He lifted his chin and swung 
his gaze around the watching cats. 
Stonewing, Strikestone, and Juniperclaw 
eyed him warily. “I left you,” he 
meowed evenly. “But now I’ve returned. 
I bring with me cats who will make our 
Clan strong again. Accept them as I 
accept you. Give them your loyalty as I 
give you mine. I am ready to lead you.” 


Silence gripped the hollow. 
Tigerstar held his breath as he watched 
his Clanmates. 

“Tigerstar!” Juniperclaw’s mew was 
the first to ring through the night air. 
Snowbird’s rose to join it. Stonewing 
and Scorchfur blinked at Tigerstar, then 
lifted their muzzles to chant their new 
leader’s name. Within moments the 
hillside echoed to the call of every cat. 

Tawnypelt’s muzzle brushed 
Tigerstar’s ear. “There is so much you 
have missed.” Her mew was filled with 
grief. “The days since you left have been 
dark. And there are darker days ahead.” 

Tigerstar’s pelt prickled along his 
spine as he drew back and met her gaze. 


“Let them come.” He lifted his tail. “We 
will be ready to face them.”

Excerpt from Bravelands: 
Broken Pride 


HEED THE CALL OF THE WILD... 
A NEW ERIN HUNTER ADVENTURE 
BEGINS 


RIN HUNTER 


R OP THE \\NFIORS)SERIES 





For generations, the animals of the African plains have been 
ruled by the code of the wild: only kill to survive. But when an 
unthinkable act of betrayal shatters the peace, a young lion, a 
baboon, and an elephant calf will be thrust together in an epic 
battle for survival. The fragile balance between predators and 


prey now rests in the paws of these unlikely heroes... . 


VZANNNININN. 





CHAPTER ONE 


Swiftcub pounced after the vultures 
shadow, but it flitted away too quickly to 
follow. Breathing hard, he pranced back 
to his pride. J saw that bird off our 
territory, he thought, delighted. No rot- 
eaters going to come near 
Gallantpride while I’m around! 

The pride needed him to defend it, 
Swiftcub thought, picking up his paws 
and strutting around his family. Why, 
right now they were all half asleep, 
dozing and basking in the shade of the 
acacia trees. The most energetic thing 
the other lions were doing was lifting 


their heads to groom their nearest 
neighbors, or their own paws. They had 
no idea of the threat Swiftcub had just 
banished. 

I might be only a few moons old, 
but my father is the strongest, bravest 
lion in Bravelands. And I’m going to be 
just like him! 

“Swiftcub!” 

The gentle but commanding voice 
snapped him out of his dreams of glory. 
He came to a halt, turning and flicking 
his ears at the regal lioness who stood 
over him. 

“Mother,” he said, shifting on his 
paws. 

“Why are you shouting at vultures?” 


Swift scolded him fondly, licking at his 
ears. “They’re nothing but scavengers. 
Come on, you and your sister can play 
later. Right now you’re supposed to be 
practicing hunting. And if you’re going 
to catch anything, you'll need to keep 
your eyes on the prey, not on the sky!” 

“Sorry, Mother.” Guiltily he padded 
after her as she led him through the dry 
grass, her tail swishing. The ground rose 
gently, and Swiftcub had to trot to keep 
up. The grasses tickled his nose, and he 
was so focused on trying not to sneeze, 
he almost bumped into his mother’s 
haunches as she crouched. 

“Oops,” he growled. 

Valor shot him a glare. His older 


sister was hunched a little to the left of 
their mother, fully focused on their 
hunting practice. Valor’s sleek body was 
low to the ground, her muscles tense; as 
she moved one paw forward with the 
utmost caution, Swiftcub tried to copy 
her, though it was hard to keep up on his 
much shorter legs. One creeping pace, 
then two. Then another. 

I’m being very quiet, just like Valor. 
I’m going to be a great hunter. He slunk 
up alongside his mother, who remained 
quite still. 

“There, Swiftcub,”’ she murmured. 
“Do you see the burrows?” 

He did, now. Ahead of the three 
lions, the ground rose up even higher, 


into a bare, sandy mound dotted with 
small shadowy holes. As Swiftcub 
watched, a small nose and whiskers 
poked out, testing the air. The meerkat 
emerged completely, stood up on its hind 
legs, and stared around. Satisfied, it 
stuck out a pink tongue and began to 
groom its chest, as more meerkats 
appeared beyond it. Growing in 
confidence, they scurried farther away 
from their burrows. 

“Careful now,” rumbled Swift. 
“They’re very quick. Go!” 

Swiftcub sprang forward, his little 
paws bounding over the ground. Still, he 
wasn’t fast enough to outpace Valor, who 
was far ahead of him already. A stab of 


disappointment spoiled his excitement, 
and suddenly it was even harder to run 
fast, but he ran grimly after his sister. 

The startled meerkats were already 
doubling back into their holes. Stubby 
tails flicked and vanished; the bigger 
leader, his round dark eyes glaring at the 
oncoming lions, was last to twist and 
dash underground. Valor’s jaws snapped 
at his tail, just missing. 

“Sky and stone!” the bigger cub 
swore, coming to a halt in a cloud of 
dust. She shook her head furiously and 
licked her jaws. “I nearly had it!” 

A rumble of laughter made Swiftcub 
turn. His father, Gallant, stood watching 
them. Swiftcub couldn’t help but feel the 


usual twinge of awe mixed in with his 
delight. Black-maned and huge, his sleek 
fur glowing golden in the sun, Gallant 
would have been intimidating if 
Swiftcub hadn’t known and loved him so 
well. Swift rose to her paws and greeted 
the great lion affectionately, rubbing his 
maned neck with her head. 

“Tt was a good attempt, Valor,” 
Gallant reassured his daughter. “What 
Swift said is true: meerkats are very 
hard to catch. You were so close—one 
day you'll be as fine a hunter as your 
mother.” He nuzzled Swift and licked 
her neck. 

“I wasnt anywhere near it,” 
grumbled Swiftcub. “T 11 never be as fast 


as Valor.” 

“Oh, you will,” said Gallant. “Don’t 
forget, Valor’s a whole year older than 
you, my son. You’re getting bigger and 
faster every day. Be patient!” He 
stepped closer, leaning in so his great 
tawny muzzle brushed Swiftcub’s own. 
“That’s the secret to stalking, too. Learn 
patience, and one day you too will be a 
very fine hunter.” 

“I hope so,” said Swiftcub meekly. 

Gallant nuzzled him. “Don’t doubt 
yourself, my cub. You’re going to be a 
great lion and the best kind of leader: 
one who keeps his own pride safe and 
content, but puts fear into the heart of his 
strongest enemy!” 


That does sound good! Feeling much 
better, Swiftcub nodded. Gallant nipped 
affectionately at the tufty fur on top of his 
head and padded toward Valor. 

Swiftcub watched him proudly. Hes 
right, of course. Father knows 
everything! And I will be a great hunter, 
I will. And a brave, strong leader— 

A tiny movement caught his eye, a 
scuttling shadow in his father’s path. 

A scorpion! 

Barely pausing to think, Swiftcub 
sprang, bowling between his father’s 
paws and almost tripping him. He 
skidded to a halt right in front of Gallant, 
snarling at the small sand-yellow 
scorpion. It paused, curling up its barbed 


tail and raising its pincers in threat. 

“No, Swiftcub!” cried his father. 

Swiftcub swiped his paw sideways 
at the creature, catching its plated shell 
and sending it flying into the long grass. 

All four lions watched the grass, 
holding their breath, waiting for a 
furious scorpion to reemerge. But there 
was no stir of movement. It must have 
fled. Swiftcub sat back, his heart 
suddenly banging against his ribs. 

“Skies above!” Gallant laughed. 
Valor gaped, and Swift dragged her cub 
into her paws and began to lick him 
roughly. 

“Mother . . .” he protested. 

“Honestly, Swiftcub!” she scolded 


him as her tongue swept across his face. 
“Your father might have gotten a nasty 
sting from that creature—but you could 
have been killed!” 

“You’re such an idiot, little brother,” 
sighed Valor, but there was admiration in 
her eyes. 

Gallant and Swift exchanged proud 
looks. “Swift,” growled Gallant, “I do 
believe the time has come to give our 
cub his true name.” 

Swift nodded, her eyes shining. 
“Now that we know what kind of lion he 
is, I think you’ re right.” 

Gallant turned toward the acacia 
trees, his tail lashing, and gave a 
resounding roar. 


It always amazed Swiftcub that the 
pride could be lying half asleep one 
moment and alert the very next. Almost 
before Gallant had finished roaring his 
summons, there was a rustle of grass, a 
crunch of paws on dry earth, and the rest 
of Gallantpride appeared, ears pricked 
and eyes bright with curiosity. Gallant 
huffed in greeting, and the twenty 
lionesses and young lions of his pride 
spread out in a circle around him, 
watching and listening intently. 

Gallant looked down again at 
Swiftcub, who blinked and glanced 
away, suddenly rather shy. “Crouch 
down,” murmured the great lion. 

When he obeyed, Swiftcub felt his 


father’s huge paw rest on his head. 

“Henceforth,” declared Gallant, 
“this cub of mine will no longer be 
known as Swiftcub. He faced a 
dangerous foe without hesitation and 
protected his pride. His name, now and 
forever, is Fearless Gallantpride.” 

It was done so quickly, Swiftcub felt 
dizzy with astonishment. 7 have my 
name! I’m Fearless. Fearless 
Gallantpride! 

All around him, his whole family 
echoed his name, roaring their approval. 
Their deep cries resonated across the 
grasslands. 

“Fearless Gallantpride!” 

“Welcome, Fearless, son of 


Gallant!’
