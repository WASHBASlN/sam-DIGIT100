                    As someone who is relatively new at the whole website development thing, it's probably important that I explore many different methods of making websites. So, during the past several weeks, I've made this website on GitHub via HTML coding, and another one on <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/sls7364/2024/02/26/hello-world/">PSU Wordpress</a>.</p>
                    
                <p class="size">I have very, <i>very</i> minimal experience with HTML coding. I took a web design class my freshman (?) (maybe sophomore) year of high school, which was mostly online due to COVID-19. What a crazy time, honestly. I'm getting off topic. I knew some HTML, forgot it, and then I kinda remembered what was up when I took this class, <i>and</i> I learned even more, which is awesome.</p>
                
                <p class="size">I like HTML. I like it a lot. It feels straightforward. There's an element, and the element does a certain thing, and as long as you know what element does what thing (which is mostly intuitive. p for paragraph, h for heading, etc), you can do basically anything you want. I have complete free reign over what I make, and it is a wonderful feeling. </p>
                <p class="size">GitHub is my only issue with my HTML coded website. I do not know how to use GitHub, mostly because of the sheer amount of buttoms and menus. It's intimidating. I also just haven't toyed with it enough to actually figure out what's what, so... We'll get to that later. The whole git add, commit, push thing was a bit confusing at first, but I think I get it. I feel like a hackerman when I use the terminal.</p>
                
                <p class="size">It's absolutely no contest. I MUCH prefer HTML/GitHub to Wordpress. I just have so much more freedom. It's simple. I type the things I want and they appear on the page. And, if they don't, I made a mistake and I just go fix it. Awesome. </p>
